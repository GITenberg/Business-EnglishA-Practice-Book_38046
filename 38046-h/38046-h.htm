<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> author of this book and the writer of this preface have
never met. Their respective fields of labor are a thousand miles
apart. Yet such is the force of ideas that many of their thoughts
and sympathies are common.</p>

<p>Business English! The very name is an anomaly. From a
literary point of view there is no such thing. English is English
whether it be used to express the creations of our imagination,
our aesthetic appreciations, or our daily wants. There is
no magical combination of words, phrases, and sentences that is
peculiar and distinctive to business transactions. Business English
as used in these pages means effective communication, both
oral and written. The author's aim throughout has been to
teach the art of using words in such a way as to make people
think and act. To do this she has applied the principles of literary
composition to the highly complex and ever increasing
problems of our business life. She realizes that business is vital,
and that the problems of commerce are not to be met and
handled with dead forms and stereotyped expressions of legal
blanks.</p>

<p>To use our language effectively it is necessary to have an
understanding of its elements. Thus the author has very wisely
devoted much space to word-study and English grammar. This
is a field commonly neglected in books on the subject. The
people engaged in business are, on the whole, woefully weak in
the grammar of our language. It is believed that the treatment
herein will be a great aid in correcting this deficiency. If we
have ideas, we must express them in words, and our words
should be so chosen and arranged as not to offend, but to please
and interest. This result can be secured by a systematic study
of Part I.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span></p>

<p>Part II deals with oral and written composition. Here the
author has arranged her subjects in such a way as to give the
whole a cumulative effect. The method throughout is inductive,
and sufficient examples are always given to warrant the
conclusions drawn. Most textbooks on Business English neglect
the subject of oral English. This book regards the spoken word
as important as the written word.</p>

<p>If there be any one feature in this textbook more to be commended
than another, it is the exposition in Part III. The
situations arising in many different kinds of business are here
analyzed. The author believes that the way to become a good
business correspondent is, first, to learn what the situation
demands and, second, to practice meeting the demands. We
must know before we write. Given a knowledge of the subject,
we must have much practice in expressing ourselves in such a
way as to make our composition effective. The author meets
this need by supplying many and varied exercises for practice.
These exercises are live, practical, and up-to-date. The problems
to be solved are real, not imaginary. Thus the power to
be gained in meeting these situations and solving these problems
will prove a real asset to those who contemplate a business
career. It is confidently hoped that both teachers and pupils
will find in this work material which will help them to prepare
themselves to meet the many problems and demands of our
growing commercial needs.</p>

<h2>BUSINESS ENGLISH</h2>




<h2>PART I&mdash;WORD STUDY AND GRAMMAR</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>INTERESTING WORDS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Business</span> English is the expression of our commercial life
in English. It is not synonymous with letter writing. To
be sure, business letters are important, but they form only a
part of one of the two large divisions into which the subject
naturally falls.</p>

<p>First, there is <i>oral expression</i>, important because so many
of our business transactions are conducted personally.
Thousands of salesmen daily move from place to place over
the entire country, earning their salaries by talking convincingly
of the goods that they have to sell. A still greater
number of clerks, salesmen, managers, and officials orally
transact business in our shops, stores, offices, and banks.
Complaints are adjusted; difficulties are disentangled; and
affairs of magnitude are consummated in personal interviews,
the matter under discussion often being thought too
important to be entrusted to correspondence. In every
business oral English is essential.</p>

<p>Second, there is <i>written expression</i>. This takes account of
the writing of advertisements, circulars, booklets, and prospectuses,
as well as of letters. And in the preparation of
these oral English is fundamental. It precedes and practically
includes the written expression. For example, we
say colloquially that a good advertisement "talks." We
mean that the writer has so fully realized the buyer's point
of view that the words of the advertisement seem to speak
directly to the reader, arousing his interest or perhaps answering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
his objection. Oral English is fundamental, too, in the
writing of letters, for most letters are dictated and not written.
The correspondent dictates them to his stenographer or
to a recording machine in the same tone, probably, that he
would use if the customer were sitting before him.</p>

<p>But in taking this point of view, we should not minimize
the importance of written business English. In a way, it is
more difficult to write well than it is to talk well. In talking
we are not troubled with the problems of correct spelling,
proper punctuation, and good paragraphing. We may even
repeat somewhat, if only we are persuasive. But in writing
we are confronted with the necessity of putting the best
thoughts into the clearest, most concise language, at the
same time obeying all the rules of spelling, punctuation, and
grammar. The business man must be sure of these details
in order to know that his letters and advertising matter are
correct. The stenographer, especially, must be thoroughly
familiar with them, so that she may correctly transcribe
what has been dictated.</p>

<p>Business English is much the same as any other English.
It consists in expression by means of words, sentences, and
paragraphs. Moreover, they are much the same kind of
words, sentences, and paragraphs that appear in any book
that is written in what is commonly called the literary style.
In a business letter the words are largely those of every day
use, and but few are technical. It is the manner in which
the words are put together, the idea back of the sentence,
that makes the only difference.</p>

<p>We shall begin the study of business English with a study
of words, for in all expression, whether oral or written, a
knowledge of words, of their meaning and suggestive power,
is fundamental. On the choice of words depends not only
the correctness but also the effectiveness of expression&mdash;the
courtesy of a letter, the appeal of an advertisement, the persuasiveness
of a salesman's talk. A mastery of words cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
be gained at once. Every time one speaks, he must consider
what words will best convey his idea. In this chapter
only the barest beginning of such study can be made. The
exercises show the value of the subject.</p>

<p>The study of words is interesting because words themselves
are interesting. Sometimes the interest consists in the
story of the derivation. As an example, consider the word
<i>italic</i>. Many words in this book are written in italic to draw
attention to them. Literally the word means "relating to
Italy or its people." It is now applied to a kind of type in
which the letters slope toward the right. The type was
called italic because it was dedicated to the states of Italy
by the inventor, Manutius, about the year 1500. An unabridged
dictionary will tell all about the word.</p>

<p>The word <i>salary</i> tells a curious story. It is derived from
a Latin word, <i>salarium</i>, meaning "salt money." It was the
name of the money that was given to the Roman soldiers
for salt, which was a part of their pay. Finally, instead of
signifying only the salt money, it came to mean the total
pay.</p>

<p>Practically all of this information a good dictionary
gives. In other words, a dictionary is a story book containing
not one, but hundreds of thousands of stories.
Whenever possible it tells what language a word came from,
how it got its different meanings, and how those meanings
have changed in the course of time. For it is natural that
words should change just as styles change, names of
ancient things being lost and names for new things being
made. As the objects themselves have gone out of use,
their names have also gone. When a word has gone entirely
out of use, it is marked <i>obsolete</i> in the dictionary.
On the other hand, new inventions must be named. Thus
new words are constantly being added to the language and
the dictionary because they are needed.</p>

<p>There is a large class of words that we shall not have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
time to consider. They are called <i>technical</i>. Every profession,
business, or trade has its distinctive words. The
technical words that a printer would use are entirely different
from those which a dentist, a bookkeeper, or a lawyer
would use. You will learn the technical terms of your
business most thoroughly after you enter it and see the use
for such terms.</p>

<p>None of the words, therefore, that you will be asked to
search out in the dictionary are, strictly speaking, technical.
It is evident that it will do you no good to search out the
words in the dictionary, unless you learn them&mdash;unless you
use them correctly in speaking and writing. There is pleasure
in thus employing new material, as everybody knows. Use
your eyes and ears. When you hear a new word, or read one,
focus the mind upon it for a moment until you can retain
a mental picture of its spelling and of its pronunciation.
Then as soon as possible look it up in the dictionary to fix its
spelling, pronunciation, and definition. Do this regularly,
and you will have reason to be proud of your vocabulary.</p>

<p>An excellent way to increase the number of words that
you know is to read the right kind of books. The careful
study of the words used in the speeches and addresses of
noted men is good practice. The conditions that called
forth the speech were probably important, and the speech
itself interesting, or it would not be preserved. When
a man has an interesting or important message to give, he
usually gives it in clear, exact, simple language. Therefore
the vocabulary that he uses is worth copying. As
for stories, there is a kind that furnishes a wealth of material
that modern authors are constantly using or referring
to, and this is found in stories of the Bible, stories of Greek
and Northern gods and goddesses, stories of the <i>Iliad</i>, the
<i>Odyssey</i>, the <i>&AElig;neid</i>, stories of chivalry&mdash;all old stories.
Every one should know them well, because they are the
basis of many allusions in which a single word oftentimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
suggests a whole story. The meaning of the word <i>herculean</i>,
for instance, is missed if you do not know the
story of Hercules and know that he was famous for
his strength.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 1</b></div>

<p><i>Atlas</i> is an interesting word. Originally it was the name of
a Greek god, who carried the world on his shoulders. Then
it is supposed that in the sixteenth century the famous
geographer Mercator prefixed his collection of maps with
the picture of Atlas supporting the world. Thus a collection
of maps in a volume came to be called an <i>atlas</i>. Consult
an unabridged dictionary for the origin of each of the
following:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PRONUNCIATION</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are judged by our speech. If we clip syllables, run
words together, or pronounce them incorrectly, we shall
merit the criticism of being careless or even ignorant. Yet
clear enunciation and correct pronunciation are sometimes
difficult. We learn most words by hearing others say them,
and, if we do not hear the true values given to the different
syllables, we shall find it hard to distinguish the correct
from the incorrect forms. Children whose parents speak a
foreign language usually have to watch their speech with
especial care; Germans, for example, find difficulty in saying
<i>th</i> and Irish people in saying <i>oi</i> as in <i>oil</i>. The exercises in
this chapter are given for the purpose of correcting such
habits. The words in the exercises should be pronounced
repeatedly, until the correct forms are instinctive.</p>

<p>Train the ear to hear the difference between sounds, as
in <i>just</i> and in <i>jest</i>. Don't slide over the final consonant in
such words as <i>going</i> and <i>reading</i>. Watch words containing
<i>wh</i>. The dictionary tells us that <i>where</i> was originally written
<i>hwar</i>, the <i>h</i> coming before the <i>w;</i> and we still pronounce it
so, although we write the <i>w</i> before the <i>h</i>. The word <i>whether</i>
is of the same kind. The dictionary tells us that it was first
spelled <i>hweder</i>. Such words should be carefully noted and
their pronunciation practiced.</p>

<p>Then there is the habit of slurring syllables. We may
understand what is meant by the expression "C'm' on" or
"Waja say?", but most of us would prefer not to be included
in the class of people who use either. Correct speech
cannot be mastered without an effort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>In the following exercises watch every vowel and every
consonant so that you may give each one its full value.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 10&mdash;Diacritical Marks</b></div>

<p>Although an <i>a</i> is always written <i>a</i>, it is not always given
the same quality or length of sound. When we discover a
new word, it is important that we know exactly the quality
to give each of the vowels in it. For this purpose <i>diacritical
marks</i> have been invented. They are illustrated in the
following list from Webster's <i>International Dictionary</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The usual way of forming the plural of English nouns is
illustrated by the words in column (<i>b</i>) above. What is it?</p>

<p>If you add <i>s</i> to the singular form <i>dress</i>, could you distinguish
the pronunciation of the plural from the pronunciation
of the singular? Does this suggest a reason for adding <i>es</i>
to form the plural?</p>

<p>How many syllables must you use to pronounce the
plural of fox? Does this suggest another reason for adding
<i>es</i> to form the plural?</p>

<p>Every word that ends in a sibilant or hissing sound (<i>ch</i>,
<i>s</i>, <i>sh</i>, <i>ss</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>z</i>) forms its plural like <i>fox</i>. Give several illustrations.</p>

<p><b>Rule 1.&mdash;Nouns regularly form the plural by adding <i>s</i>,

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WORD ANALYSIS</div>


<p>To learn English words thoroughly we must spend some
thought on the way in which they are made up, on the language
from which they have been derived, and on the changes
in meaning made by adding prefixes and suffixes. Three
important influences in building the English have been the
Anglo-Saxon, the Greek, and the Latin languages. The
simplest words in the language are Anglo-Saxon. The following
exercises illustrate how words have been multiplied
by Anglo-Saxon prefixes and suffixes.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 46</b></div>

<p>Name as many words as you can that make use of each
of the following prefixes. Give only such as are recognizable
English words without the prefix.</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Exercise 46">
<tr><td align='left'><i>a</i>&mdash;aboard</td><td align='left'><i>mis</i>&mdash;misjudge</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>be</i>&mdash;becalm</td><td align='left'><i>un</i>&mdash;unknown</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>fore</i>&mdash;foretell&nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td align='left'><i>up</i>&mdash;uproot</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Give the meaning of each of the prefixes used above.</p>

<p>What part of speech does each prefix make?</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 47</b></div>

<p>Using the following Teutonic suffixes, form English words.
Be careful that the root taken alone is an English word.</p>



<div class='center'>

<p>What does each suffix mean?</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 48</b></div>

<p>As above, form words using the following suffixes:</p>

words, the final consonant of each is often changed to the
initial consonant of the root to which it is joined.</p>

<p>The suffixes <i>able</i> and <i>ible</i> are sometimes troublesome
because it is difficult to know which ending to write. As
a rule, if the new word was made from another English word,
the ending is <i>able</i>, as <i>blamable</i>. The words ending in <i>ible</i>
are derived from the Latin, and, as a rule, the ending cannot
easily be separated from the root and still leave the latter
an English word. Examples are:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SENTENCE AND ITS ELEMENTS</div>


<p>In the preceding chapters we have seen words as they
are used singly. We studied their pronunciation and the
way in which they were formed to express a definite meaning.
In this chapter we shall begin a review of grammar,
a study of words not according to their pronunciation or
their definition, but according to their use as they are
arranged with other words to express complete ideas. The
simplest group into which words are thus arranged is the
sentence, consisting of two important parts, the subject
and the predicate. The subject is the part about which
something is told, and the predicate is the part that tells
about the subject; as,</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="subject and predicate">
<tr><td align='center'><i>Subject</i>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align='center'><i>Predicate</i></td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>The sun&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>shines brightly</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>There are several different kinds of sentences, named
according to the meaning which they express. They are
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
The <i>declarative</i> sentence states a fact.<br />
The <i>interrogative</i> sentence asks a question.<br />
The <i>imperative</i> sentence commands or entreats.<br />
The <i>exclamatory</i> sentence expresses deep feeling.<br />
</div>

<div class='center'><br /><i>Illustrations</i></div>

<div>
<i>Declarative:</i> John closed the door.<br />
<i>Interrogative:</i> Did John close the door?<br />
<i>Imperative:</i> Close the door.<br />
<i>Exclamatory:</i> What a noise the door made!<br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Sentences are classified, also, according to their structure
or form. If a sentence has one subject and one predicate,
it is a <i>simple</i> sentence. If it is made up of two independent
parts, it is a <i>compound</i> sentence. If it has one independent
part and one or more dependent parts, each of which contains
a subject and a predicate of its own, the sentence is
<i>complex</i>. The independent part of the sentence is called a
<i>principal clause</i>, and the dependent part is called a <i>subordinate
clause</i>. A <i>phrase</i> is also a dependent part of a
sentence, but it differs from a subordinate clause in that
it contains no subject or predicate. Both phrases and
subordinate clauses are used as parts of speech, as nouns,
adjectives, or adverbs. Thus we have the following definitions:</p>

<p>A <i>simple</i> sentence contains one principal clause.</p>

<p>A <i>compound</i> sentence contains two or more principal
clauses.</p>

<p>A <i>complex</i> sentence contains one principal clause and one
or more subordinate clauses.</p>

<p>A <i>phrase</i> is a group of related words used as a part of
speech. (See <a href="#Exercise_68">Exercises 68</a> and <a href="#Exercise_69">69</a>.)</p>

<p>A <i>clause</i> is a group of words containing a subject and a
predicate. A subordinate clause is used as a part of speech.
It usually has an introductory word to distinguish it from
a principal clause. (See <a href="#Exercise_71">Exercise 71</a>.)</p>

<div class='center'><br /><i>Illustrations</i></div>

<div class='hang1'><i>Simple sentence:</i> To-day most of the world's big questions are
business questions.</div>

<div class='hang1'><i>Complex sentence:</i> The view <i>that</i> business is only humdrum routine
and sordid money-making needs revising, <i>since</i>
most of the world's big questions are business questions.</div>

<div class='hang1'><i>Compound sentence:</i> Many people still belittle business, calling
it humdrum routine and sordid money-making, <i>but</i>
this view needs revising.</div>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 60&mdash;Sentence Errors</b></div>

<p><b>S. 1.</b> <span class="smcap">The Baby Blunder.</span>&mdash;In writing, one of the
most elementary forms of correctness is shown in the proper
division into sentences. The ability instinctively to end a
sentence at the right place is called the "sentence sense."
Students who do not possess it or who have not learned
the difference between sentences, subordinate clauses, and
phrases frequently make the mistake of setting off too
much or too little for one sentence. For example, they run
two sentences together as one; as,</p>

<p><i>Wrong:</i> Motor wagons are economical, department stores of
all large cities are acquiring them.</p>

<p>The sentence, as written above, contains one form of the
sentence error&mdash;one of the worst possible mistakes in
writing. It is sometimes called the <i>comma fault</i> or the
<i>baby blunder</i>. For brevity we shall call it <i>S 1</i> (sentence error
number one). <i>Motor wagons are economical</i> is a principal
clause. <i>Department stores of all large cities are acquiring them</i>
is also a principal clause. Two such clauses may not stand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in the same sentence separated only by a comma. To correct,
divide into two sentences; as,</p>

<p><i>Right:</i> Motor wagons are economical. Department stores of
all large cities are acquiring them.</p>

<p>Sometimes the thought in the two principal clauses is
closely connected. In that case they may be put into the
same sentence, provided they are properly connected or
separated. Use a comma <i>plus</i> a co&ouml;rdinate conjunction (as
<i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, <i>but</i>) to connect them, or a semicolon (;) to separate
them.</p>

<p>Be particularly careful of the conjunctive adverbs <i>so</i>, <i>then</i>,
<i>therefore</i>, <i>thus</i>, <i>also</i>, <i>still</i>, <i>otherwise</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>hence</i>, <i>consequently</i>,
<i>moreover</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>. When they are used to join
the principal clauses of a compound sentence, a comma is
not sufficient punctuation between the clauses. A semicolon
or a comma and a co&ouml;rdinate conjunction must be
used.</p>

<p><i>Wrong:</i> He had been a good customer, so they were sorry to
lose his trade.</p>

<p><i>Right:</i> He had been a good customer; so they were sorry to
lose his trade.</p>

<p><i>Right:</i> He had been a good customer, and so they were sorry
to lose his trade.</p>

<p><b>S. 2.</b>&mdash;The first form of the sentence error (<i>S 1</i>) is made
by using too much for one sentence. The second form (<i>S 2</i>)
is made by using too little. It consists in writing a subordinate
clause or a phrase as a sentence; as,</p>

<p>1. <i>Wrong:</i> I told her I would attend to the matter at my
earliest convenience. <i>Probably on my way from work in the evening.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>Wrong:</i> His doctor advised him to go to Arizona. <i>Which
he decided to do.</i></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 61</b></div>

<p>Each sentence should express one complete thought.
Some of the following are really two sentences (<i>S 1</i>), and
some are only parts of sentences (<i>S 2</i>). Correct each, naming
the mistake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 63&mdash;Parts of Speech</b></div>

<p>There are eight different kinds of words called parts of
speech, which are used to make sentences. They are as
follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Names of words">
<tr><td align='left'><i>Noun:</i> The <i>horse</i> is brown.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>Pronoun:</i> <i>He</i> is the best horse of all.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>Verb:</i> He <i>galloped</i> to town.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>Adjective:</i> The <i>brown</i> horse is my favorite.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>Adverb:</i> He runs <i>swiftly</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>Preposition:</i> We shall ride <i>to</i> town.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>Conjunction:</i> The night is clear <i>and</i> cold.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>Interjection:</i> <i>Oh!</i> My horse stumbled.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Thus a <i>noun</i> names something. A word that stands for
a noun is a <i>pronoun</i>. Sometimes a different part of speech
is used like a noun, and for the time being it becomes a noun.
The <i>verb</i> is a very important part of speech, since without it
there can be no sentence. The verb makes an assertion,
asks a question, or gives a command. <i>Adjectives</i> are words
that belong to or describe nouns or pronouns. Adverbs go
with or modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. <i>Prepositions</i>
and <i>conjunctions</i> connect. Prepositions join their
objects to other words in the sentence; conjunctions join
words, phrases, or clauses. An <i>interjection</i>, such as the
exclamation <i>oh</i>, is used without having grammatical relation
to any other word in the sentence. A preposition always
takes an object, the preposition and its object making a
<i>phrase</i>. Grouping this information, we have:</p>

<p>A word is not always the same part of speech. We may
say, "Did you <i>starch</i> the clothes?" in which case <i>starch</i> is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a verb. A grocer may say, "The <i>starch</i> in these packages is
always clean." In this sentence <i>starch</i> is a noun. The
part of speech depends entirely on the way the word is used.</p>

<p>In the following, name the part of speech of each word in
italic. Judge by the way the word is used in the sentence.</p>

<p>The classes to which nouns belong are distinguished as
follows:</p>

<p>A <i>common</i> noun is the name given to an object to denote
the class to which it belongs; as, <i>book</i>, <i>man</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>proper</i> noun is the name given to a particular object to
distinguish it from others of the same class; as, <i>Mary</i>, <i>Republicans</i>,
<i>England</i>. Proper nouns should always be capitalized.</p>

<p>A <i>collective</i> noun is a name which in the singular denotes
a collection. It is usually plural in idea but singular in use;
as, <i>congregation</i>, <i>crowd</i>.</p>

<p>An <i>abstract</i> noun is the name denoting a quality of an
object; as, <i>power</i>, <i>purity</i>, <i>strength</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>verbal</i> noun is the name of an action. As its name
suggests, it is made from a verb; as, <i>Sweeping</i> is good
exercise.</p>

<p>The different classes of pronouns are distinguished as
follows:</p>

<p>The <i>personal</i> pronoun is used in place of the name of a
person or thing. The pronoun of the <i>first</i> person indicates
the speaker, the pronoun of the <i>second</i> person indicates the
person spoken to, and the pronoun of the <i>third</i> person indicates
the person spoken of. They are declined as follows:</p>

<i>Mine</i> is used as a substitute for a possessive pronoun and the noun it
modifies.</p></div>

<p>The personal pronouns compounded with <i>self</i> are of two
kinds:</p>

<p>1. <i>Emphatic</i> pronouns; as,</p>

<div class='center'>
The buyer <i>himself</i> told me.<br />

<p>2. <i>Reflexive</i> pronouns, referring back to the subject and
at the same time being in the objective case; as,</p>

<div class='center'>
John slipped and hurt <i>himself</i>.<br />
</div>

<p>The <i>relative</i> pronoun is so called because it relates or refers
to another word, called its antecedent, to which it joins the
clause that it introduces. The relative pronouns are <i>who</i>,
<i>which</i>, <i>what</i>, <i>that;</i> and the compound relatives are <i>whoever</i>,
<i>whosoever</i>, <i>whichever</i>, <i>whichsoever</i>, <i>whatever</i>, <i>whatsoever</i>.</p>

<p><i>That</i>, <i>what</i>, <i>whichever</i>, <i>whichsoever</i>, <i>whatever</i>, and <i>whatsoever</i>
are not declined. They have the same form in the
nominative and objective cases, and are not used in the
possessive case.</p>

<p><i>What</i> is peculiar in that it never has an antecedent
expressed, but itself stands for both antecedent and relative.
It is called the <i>double relative</i>. Compare the following:</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Exercise 76 part 4">
<tr><td align='left'>I did not hear <i>the words that</i> he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>I did not hear <i>that which</i> he said.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>I did not hear <i>what</i> he said.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><i>That</i> is called the restrictive relative, because it limits or
restricts its antecedent to the meaning expressed in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
clause introduced by <i>that</i>. A restrictive clause is one, therefore,
that is needed to make the meaning of the sentence
clear. Compare the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Non-restrictive:</i> John Brown, <i>who</i> has no disease, needs no
physician.</p>

<p><i>Restrictive:</i> He <i>that</i> hath no disease needs no physician.</p></div>

<p>Notice that a restrictive, or necessary, clause is not separated
from the rest of the sentence by commas.</p>

<p><i>Who</i> and <i>which</i> are sometimes used with restrictive force;
as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Those <i>who</i> have finished their work may leave. (Not everybody.)</p>

<p>2. Have you read the book <i>which</i> he recommended? (He recommended
but one.)</p></div>

<p><i>Interrogative</i> pronouns are used in asking questions. They
are <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>what</i>. <i>Who</i> refers to persons; <i>which</i> refers
to persons or things, and is used to distinguish one object
from another; <i>what</i> refers to things. They are declined as
follows:</p>

<p>The interrogative pronouns <i>which</i> and <i>what</i> are frequently
used as adjectives. In this case they are called <i>pronominal
adjectives</i>. Compare:</p>

<p>The <i>demonstrative</i> pronouns are <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> with their
plurals <i>these</i> and <i>those</i>. They are always used to point out,
or demonstrate, the noun to which they refer. <i>This</i> and
<i>these</i> are used for objects near at hand, or recently named;
<i>that</i> and <i>those</i> are used for objects far away, or not recently
named.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Indefinite</i> pronouns refer to objects or persons, but do not
define or limit them. The indefinite pronouns are <i>each</i>,
<i>every</i>, <i>either</i>, <i>neither</i>, <i>one</i>, <i>none</i>, <i>other</i>, <i>another</i>, <i>few</i>, <i>all</i>, <i>many</i>,
<i>several</i>, <i>some</i>, <i>each other</i>, <i>one another</i>, and the compounds
<i>any one</i>, <i>some one</i>, <i>every one</i>, <i>something</i>, <i>nothing</i>. Indefinite
pronouns are frequently used as adjectives. <i>Each</i>, <i>every</i>,
<i>either</i>, <i>one</i>, <i>another</i>, <i>any one</i>, <i>some one</i>, <i>every one</i>, whether they
are used as pronouns or as adjectives, are singular in number.
If another pronoun is used to refer to one of them, it must
be in the singular number.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b><a name="Exercise_80" id="Exercise_80"></a>Exercise 80&mdash;Case</b></div>

<p>Case is that modification of a noun or a pronoun which
denotes its relation to other words in the sentence. There
are three cases: the <i>nominative</i>, the <i>objective</i>, and the <i>possessive</i>.
Although nouns are used in all three cases, no change
of form occurs except in the possessive case.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>nominative</i> case is used in the following ways:</p>

<p>1. The principal use of the nominative case is as <i>subject</i>
of the sentence; as,</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Exerise 80 part 1">

<tr><td align='left'><i>Pronoun:</i>&nbsp; </td><td align='left'><i>It</i> has been established for five years.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>2. Sometimes a noun or pronoun is used to complete the
meaning of such verbs as <i>be</i>, <i>become</i>, <i>seem</i>, <i>appear</i>, <i>taste</i>, <i>feel</i>.
Such a noun is in the nominative case, and is called a <i>predicate
nominative</i>, or a <i>subjective complement;</i> as,</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Exercise 80 part 2">

<tr><td align='left'><i>Pronoun:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td align='left'>I think it is <i>she</i>.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>3. A noun in <i>apposition</i> with another noun in the nominative
case is also in the nominative case; as,</p>



<div class='center'>

<p>4. Sometimes a noun or a pronoun is used in direct address
or in an exclamation, without having any grammatical
relation to the rest of the sentence. It is then said to be
<i>nominative independent;</i> as,</p>



<div class='center'>

<tr><td align='left'><i>You!</i> I thought you were in South America.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>5. Sometimes a noun or pronoun is used with a participle
to express an adverbial relation. Such a noun is in the
nominative case, and is called <i>nominative absolute</i>, because
it has no grammatical relation to any other part of the
sentence; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Mr. Brown</i> having gone, we told the gentleman to see Mr.
Jones.</p>

<p><i>He</i> being the guide, we asked no questions.</p></div>

<p>It is much better to use a clause to express such an idea; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As Mr. Brown had gone, we told the gentleman to see Mr.
Jones.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 81&mdash;The Objective Case</b></div>

<p>A noun or a pronoun may be used in the objective case
in the following ways:</p>

<p>1. Direct object of a transitive verb; as,</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
I have a good <i>position</i>.<br />

<p>2. Object of a preposition; as,</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
I have just returned from the <i>library.</i><br />
Bring the book to <i>me</i>.<br />
</div>

<p>3. Indirect object of such verbs as <i>ask</i>, <i>give</i>, <i>teach</i>, showing
the person for whom or to whom the action is done; as,</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
She brought <i>her mother</i> some flowers.<br />
I gave <i>her</i> singing lessons.<br />
</div>

<p>4. A noun as <i>second object</i> after verbs of <i>making</i>, <i>choosing</i>,
<i>calling</i>, <i>electing;</i> as,</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>

<div class='center'><br /><b><a name="Exercise_82" id="Exercise_82"></a>Exercise 82&mdash;The Possessive Case</b></div>

<p>To form the possessive case of nouns add an <i>apostrophe</i>
and <i>s</i> to all singular nouns, and to all plural nouns that do
not end in <i>s;</i> if a plural <i>noun</i> ends in <i>s</i> add only an apostrophe;
as, <i>child's</i>, <i>children's</i>, <i>boys'</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Exception.</i>&mdash;When, in long words, the additional <i>s</i> in the
singular would cause a disagreeable sound, some writers use
only the apostrophe; as,</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
We awaited the <i>princess's</i> decision.<br />
We awaited the <i>princess'</i> decision.</div></div>

<p>It is often better in such cases to use a phrase; as,</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
We awaited the decision <i>of the princess</i>.<br />
</div>

<p>Thus, an <i>of</i> phrase may be used instead of the possessive
case. In speaking of an inanimate object one should use it
instead of the apostrophe and <i>s;</i> as, <i>the top of the mountain</i>.
However, we use such expressions as <i>last year's prices</i>.</p>

<p>When, as in the name of a firm, two or more nouns are
taken together with the idea of common possession, the sign
of the possessive is added to the last noun only. If separate
possession is implied, the sign of the possessive is added to
each noun; as,</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
Have you seen <i>Wilson &amp; King's</i> new building?<br />
This is <i>Mary and Helen's</i> room.<br />
Is this <i>Mary's or Helen's</i> coat?<br />
</div>

<p>A noun or pronoun is in the possessive case before a verbal
noun; as,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
I prefer to have <i>John's</i> studying done before dinner.<br />
I prefer to have <i>his</i> studying done before dinner.<br />
</div>

<p>Write sentences expressing relation between the words
in the following pairs. Use one of them in the possessive
case or use an <i>of</i> phrase, whichever seems better.</p>

<p>Until the habit of correct usage is formed, every sentence
must be watched. When a word modifies a verb, an adjective,
or an adverb, another adverb must be used, and an
adjective may not correctly be substituted. As a rule,
adverbs express the following ideas:</p>



<div class='center'>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Adverb modifying a verb: See how <i>slowly</i> the man walks!</p>

<p>Adverb modifying an adjective: The weather has been <i>extremely</i>
warm.</p>

<p>Adverb modifying an adverb: He dictates <i>very</i> rapidly.</p></div>

<p>It must be remembered, however, that verbs of the

<p>Name the adjectives in the following selection, explaining
with what noun each belongs.</p>

<p>Name the adverbs, explaining what part of speech each
modifies.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Since 1904 the number of live cattle exported from this country
has been steadily growing smaller. Exports of dressed beef
have also shrunk to such insignificant proportions that the United
States is no longer an important factor in the foreign markets
for beef. Often has it been said that the competition of cheap
Argentine beef has deprived us of foreign markets. It would
be more nearly true to say that foreigners buy the inferior article
only because we cannot supply them with all they want of the best
grade. Take, for instance, the Englishman's willingness to pay
considerably more for American corn-fed beef than for Argentine.</p>

<p>The raising of cattle is important, also, from the standpoint
of the leather business. Obviously, with a 21 per cent increase
in population in each decade, many more shoes are necessary.
Automobile and other industries are making constantly increasing
demands for leather. Shoes cannot become cheaper in the
face of increased demand and diminished supply. Too much
depends upon the cattle industry for us to allow it to wane.</p></div>

the following sentences. Remember that an adverb must
stand as closely as possible to the word that it modifies, but
remember also that an infinitive, although made up of two

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 93&mdash;Comparison</b></div>

<p>Adjectives are compared so as to express different degrees
of quality. There are three degrees of comparison, the <i>positive</i>,
the <i>comparative</i>, and the <i>superlative</i>. When the object
modified or described by the adjective is not compared with
another, the first or <i>positive</i> degree is used. When two
objects are compared, the second or <i>comparative</i> degree is
used to denote more or less of the quality expressed by the
adjective. When several objects are compared, the <i>superlative</i>
degree of the adjective is used to express the highest
or the lowest possible degree of the adjective.</p>

<p>The usual method of comparing an adjective is to add
<i>er</i> to the positive to form the comparative, and <i>est</i> to form
the superlative. Frequently, however, especially for an
adjective of two or more syllables, the comparative is formed
by prefixing <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> to the positive, and the superlative
by prefixing <i>most</i> or <i>least</i>. Besides the adjectives in
these two classes there are some which do not follow any
regular method and must, therefore, be watched a little
more closely.</p>

<p>The following table illustrates the different methods of
comparison:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Exercise 93 part 1">
<tr><td align='center'><i>Positive</i>&nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td align='center'><i>Comparative</i>&nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td align='center'><i>Superlative</i>&nbsp; &nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'>dangerous</td><td align='left'>more dangerous&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td align='left'>most dangerous</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'>bad</td><td align='left'>worse</td><td align='left'>worst</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>ill</td><td align='left'>worse</td><td align='left'>worst</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Be careful to avoid using a double sign for the comparative
degree; as,</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Wrong:</i> This writing is <i>more neater</i> than yours.<br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

the positive degree in itself expresses a complete or <i>absolute</i>
meaning; as,</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE VERB</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Verbs</span> may be <i>transitive</i> or <i>intransitive</i>.</p>

<p>A verb is transitive when it needs an object to complete
its meaning; that is, when the action passes over (Latin,
<i>transire</i>, to pass over) from the subject or doer to the object
or receiver; as,</p>

<div class='center'>
He <i>hit</i> the ball.<br />
</div>

<p>A verb is intransitive when it needs no object to complete
its meaning; as,</p>

<div class='center'>
The crowd <i>cheered</i>.<br />
</div>

<p>Some intransitive verbs require a predicate noun or pronoun
in the nominative case, or an adjective, to complete
their meaning. They are the verbs <i>be</i>, <i>become</i>, <i>appear</i>,
<i>seem</i>, <i>feel</i>, <i>taste</i>, <i>look</i>, <i>smell;</i> as,</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 99&mdash;Voice</b></div>

<p>Voice is that property of the verb that shows whether the
subject acts or is acted upon. If the subject acts, the verb
is in the <i>active voice</i>. If the subject is acted upon, the verb
is in the <i>passive voice</i>. Every sentence containing a transitive verb must have the following parts:</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Exercise 99">
<tr><td align='center'><i>Agent</i>(doer)</td><td align='center'><i>Action</i></td><td align='center'><i>Receiver</i></td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>The runaway horse</td><td align='left'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; injured&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td align='left'>John.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>When the sentence is in the order shown above, the subject
is the agent, and the verb expresses the action of the
agent. When the sentence is written in this order, the
verb is said to be in the <i>active voice</i>.</p>

<p>However, without changing the meaning of the sentence,
we may change the order of the ideas; thus,</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Exercise 99 part 2">
<tr><td align='center'><i>Receiver</i></td><td align='center'><i>Action</i></td><td align='center'><i>Agent</i></td></tr>

</table></div>
<p>The receiver of the action has become the subject, and the
agent has become part of the predicate, being expressed in
the phrase <i>by the runaway horse</i>. When the sentence is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
expressed in this order, the subject receiving or "suffering"
the action, the verb is said to be in the <i>passive voice</i>. Only
transitive verbs, therefore, may be changed to the passive
voice.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;There are certain intransitive verbs that sometimes have
a preposition so closely connected with them that the two are treated
almost like a transitive verb, and may be made passive; as,</p></div>

<p>Write five sentences in the active voice.</p>

<p>Change them to the passive voice.</p>

<p>In the sentences that you have written, is the active form
of the verb or the passive form better? Which is more direct
in its wording? Which, then, is the better form to use
regularly?</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 100&mdash;Number and Person</b></div>

<p>The number of the verb is decided by the number of the
subject. If the subject is a singular noun, or a pronoun that
stands for a singular noun, it requires a singular verb; if
the subject is plural, it requires a plural verb. As a rule,
there is no difference between the singular and the plural
forms of the verb except in the form for the third person
singular; as,</p>



<div class='center'>

<p>The tense of the verb indicates the time of the action.
There are three primary tenses, indicating action in the
<i>present</i>, the <i>past</i>, and the <i>future</i>. Each of these tenses has
also a <i>perfect</i> tense, which, represents the action as being
perfect or complete in the present, the past, and the future.</p>

<p>The <i>present</i> tense is the simplest form. It denotes that
the action takes place now; as,</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 104&mdash;Shall and Will</b></div>

<p>The auxiliary verbs used to form the future tenses are
<i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>. The two must be carefully distinguished
because they denote different ideas, according to the person
with which they are used. The rule is, to express simple
future time, use <i>shall</i> in the first person, <i>will</i> in the second
and third persons.</p>

<p>The future tense of the verb <i>walk</i> is conjugated as follows:</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Exercise 104 part 1">
<tr><td align='left'>I shall walk</td><td align='left'>We shall walk</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>You will walk&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td align='left'>You will walk</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>He will walk</td><td align='left'>They will walk</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This is the form to use when you expect the action to
take place naturally.</p>

<p>On the other hand, instead of letting things take their
natural course as they do in the simple future, you may
force them to take place. You may, for example, be determined
to walk, or determined to make some one else walk.
In that case the use is reversed; as,</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Exercise 104 part 2">
<tr><td align='left'>I will walk</td><td align='left'>We will walk</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>You shall walk&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td align='left'>You shall walk</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>He shall walk</td><td align='left'>They shall walk</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This form is used whenever the speaker has authority to
bring about the action indicated by the verb.</p>

<p>In questions of the first person always use <i>shall</i>. In
questions of the second and third persons use the same

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 105&mdash;Should and Would</b></div>

<p><i>Should</i> and <i>would</i> are the past tenses of <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>
and, in general, express the same ideas as do <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>,
except that <i>should</i> sometimes means <i>ought;</i> as,</p>

<div class="center">You <i>should</i> not speak in that way.</div>

<p><i>Would</i>, also, sometimes indicates an action that occurs
frequently; as,</p>

<div class="center">She <i>would</i> often sit at the window all the morning.</div>

<p>The use of <i>should</i> and <i>would</i> in indirect statements and
questions is sometimes puzzling. First of all, decide whether
<i>shall</i> or <i>will</i> would be used in the direct form of the sentence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
If the direct form uses <i>shall</i>, use <i>should</i> in the indirect; if
the direct uses <i>will</i>, use <i>would</i> in the indirect; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p><i>Direct:</i> The market <i>will</i> improve.</p>

<p><i>Indirect:</i> He said that the market <i>would</i> improve.</p></div>

<p>In conditional clauses (<i>if</i>), use <i>should</i> for all persons.</p>

<p>Insert <i>should</i> or <i>would</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. If I knew his address, I &mdash;&mdash; send him a telegram.</p>

<p>2. He promised that he &mdash;&mdash; not make the mistake again.
(The direct form would read, I will not &mdash;&mdash; )</p>

<p>3. I promised that I &mdash;&mdash; not make the mistake again.</p>

<p>4. You promised that you &mdash;&mdash; not make the mistake again.</p>

<p>5. Do you think that I &mdash;&mdash; go?</p>

<p>6. I &mdash;&mdash; if I were you.</p>

<p>7. I &mdash;&mdash; think he &mdash;&mdash; know better than to apply for that
position.</p>

<p>8. John said that, no matter what we thought, he &mdash;&mdash; not go.</p>

<p>9. If you &mdash;&mdash; decide to accept the offer, let me know at
once.</p>

<p>10. I am sorry he did that. He &mdash;&mdash; not, of course.</p>

<p>11. If I &mdash;&mdash; see him, I'd let him know.</p>

<p>12. If he &mdash;&mdash; come during my absence, ask him to wait.</p>

used as adjectives. Thus at the same time each acts as two
parts of speech. As verbs both have the meaning of the
verbs from which they are made; both have tense and voice;
both may be modified by adverbial expressions; and, if they
are made from transitive verbs, both may take objects.</p>

<div class='center'><b>The Participle</b></div>

<p>The tenses and voices of the participle are as follows:</p>

<p>The participle frequently introduces a phrase. Usually
the phrase is used like an adjective; occasionally it is used
like a noun (sometimes called the <i>gerund</i> phrase).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><b>The Infinitive</b></div>

<p>Grouping all the facts that we have thus far learned about

<p>Phrases are important because, like clauses, they help us
to vary the form of our sentences. They help us, above all,
to avoid the childish <i>so</i> habit. Thus, instead of <i>They wished
to make the ice smooth so they flooded the pond</i>, we may use,
for example:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Subordinate clause:</i> Because (as, since) they wished to make the
ice smooth, they flooded the pond.</p>

<p><i>Participial phrase:</i> Wishing to make the ice smooth, they
flooded the pond.</p>

<p><i>Infinitive phrase:</i> To make the ice smooth, they flooded the pond.</p>

<p><i>Gerund phrase:</i> Flooding the pond made the ice smooth.</p>

<p><i>Prepositional phrase modifying noun subject:</i> The flooding of
the pond made the ice smooth.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 122&mdash;Mode</b></div>

<p>Mode is the form of the verb that indicates the manner of
expressing the thought. The <i>modes</i>, or <i>moods</i>, that every
one should be able to distinguish are the <i>indicative</i> and the
<i>subjunctive</i>. If the verb indicates a fact, we say it is in the
indicative mode; if it expresses a supposition, a doubt, a
statement contrary to fact, or a wish, we say it is in the
subjunctive mode.</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="subjunctive mode">
<tr><td align='left'>You <i>are</i> good.</td><td align='left'>(A fact&mdash;indicative.)</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>I wish I <i>were</i> good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>(Contrary to fact, a wish&mdash;subjunctive.)</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In form the indicative and the subjunctive differ in the
present and the past tenses of the verb <i>to be</i>, as follows:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Lesson 122 part 2">

</table></div>

<p>Other verbs in the subjunctive mode do not end in <i>s</i> in
the third person singular number, but use the same form
as the other persons in the singular number; as, <i>if he go</i>, <i>if
she walk</i>.</p>

<p><i>If</i>, <i>though</i>, <i>although</i>, or <i>lest</i> usually introduce the subjunctive
form.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>In modern English, the use of the subjunctive is becoming
rare except in the past and past perfect tenses in statements
contrary to fact, and in wishes, which are really
statements contrary to fact; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. If I were a king (but I'm not), I'd see that my laws were
obeyed.</p>

<p>2. I wish I were a king! (but I'm not).</p>

<p>3. If I had been careful, my work would be good. (I was not
careful.)</p>

<p>4. I wish I had been careful! (I was not.)</p></div>

<p>Notice that the verb is in the past or in the past perfect
tense.</p>

<p>There are some careful writers who still use the present
subjunctive to show a <i>possibility;</i> as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Lest he start too late, remind him again that he must meet the
4:15 train.</p></div>

<p>In the following sentences, which form is better? May
any of the sentences use either form?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. I wish I <i>was</i>&mdash;<i>were</i> rich.</p>

<p>2. If I <i>was</i>&mdash;<i>were</i> you, I should go at once.</p>

<p>3. If his work <i>was</i>&mdash;<i>were</i> exact, he would have no trouble in
holding a position.</p>

<p>4. If it <i>was</i>&mdash;<i>were</i> true, why didn't you say so?</p>

<p>5. If he <i>was</i>&mdash;<i>were</i> a millionaire, he could not have been
more lavish.</p>

<p>6. If such a thing <i>was</i>&mdash;<i>were</i> possible, our government would
be no government.</p>

<p>7. If the election <i>was</i>&mdash;<i>were</i> postponed, we should have been
informed.</p></div>

each case giving a reason for your choice. Remember that
the indicative <i>was</i> is used to denote a statement of fact

plural) is used to denote a possibility, something that is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Retell</span> a story that you know or one that the instructor
has read to you. See if you can tell the whole story in fairly
long sentences without using a single <i>and</i>. You will be
allowed to use three <i>and's</i>. As soon as you say the third,
you must take your seat. Let the class keep count.</p>

<p>The story may be an anecdote, a fable, or any other short
incident that can easily be told in one or two minutes. You
probably have read many such or have heard your father and
your mother tell them. A joke that can be told in two or
three sentences will not be long enough.</p>

<p>The excessive use of <i>and</i> spoils the telling of many stories.
It is a mistake to think that the gap between the end of
one sentence and the beginning of the next appears as great
to the listener as it does to us as we are deliberating what
to say next. To avoid the gap we bridge the two sentences
with <i>and</i>. Its use in this way is hardly ever necessary if we
think out a sentence to the end before we begin to speak it.
When we have finished the thought, we should finish the
sentence without trying to bind it artificially to the next
one. The sentences will be bound together if the thought
of one grows out of the thought of the preceding one.</p>

<p>If the unfolding of the idea does not seem sufficient to tie
the parts, there are better expressions to use than <i>and</i>.
There are short expressions like <i>in this way</i>, <i>likewise</i>, <i>moreover</i>,
<i>thus</i>, <i>therefore</i>, <i>besides</i>, <i>as might be expected</i>, and <i>too</i>. Another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
way to avoid <i>and</i> is to change the form of the sentence:
(1) better than the form, "I opened the window <i>and saw</i>,"
is, "<i>Opening</i> the window, I saw;" (2) better than "I am
going to the store <i>and buy</i> some sugar," is, "I am going to
the store <i>to buy</i> some sugar;" (3) better than "There was
a boy <i>and his name</i> was John," is, "There was a boy <i>whose</i>
name was John;" (4) better than "I reached home <i>and
found</i> that my cousin had arrived," is, "<i>When</i> I reached
home, I found that my cousin had arrived." In place of
<i>and</i>, therefore, we may use (1) participles, (2) infinitives,
(3) relative pronouns, and (4) subordinate conjunctions.</p>

<p>Above all, avoid <i>and everything</i>, as in, "I washed the
dishes and swept the floor and everything." To try thus to
complete an idea that is already complete shows childishness.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 136</b></div>

<p>Very likely in telling the story as suggested above you
found yourself frequently using the word <i>so</i> to connect two
sentences. Perhaps, too, you used <i>why</i> to begin sentences.</p>

<p>Now tell one of your own experiences, being careful not
to use <i>and</i>, <i>so</i>, or <i>why</i>. Introduce as much conversation as
possible. What, if any, is the advantage of telling a story
in the first person? Why is it good to introduce conversation?</p>

<p>In your conversation make use of several of the following
words:</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 137</b></div>

<p>Far too many boys and girls pay but little regard to
the matter of choosing the word that will give the exact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
meaning that they wish to convey. In order to lend force
to their words they have formed the habit of speaking
in superlatives; like the girl who said, "We had a perfectly
grand time, but I'm so beastly tired now that I'm
nearly dead," and yet she showed no evidence of suffering.</p>

<p>Isn't it a pity that our beautiful English language should
be so degraded in common usage that it loses all its force
and meaning? Instead of convincing people that she really
was tired, the girl quoted above made herself ridiculous by
her exaggeration. Yet isn't the quotation a fair example of
the speech of many boys and girls? Surely everything
about us is not either grand or beastly. The habit thus
formed is difficult to break, but it must be broken if we wish
to speak our language correctly.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Make a list of the slang phrases that you have acquired.
For each one substitute a good English expression.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The reason we must watch our oral English closely is that
it is in our conversation that our habits of speech are formed.
The expressions we use then we unconsciously employ when
we are writing or talking to the class. If we are accustomed
to use considerable slang when we speak, we shall have
difficulty in eliminating it from our writing or in finding a
good word to express the idea for which we usually use slang.
As a rule, slang and extravagant expressions of all kinds are
used to serve such a variety of meanings that the use of them
tends to limit the vocabulary to these expressions. Consider
slang something undesirable and stop using it.</p>

<p>Look up the words in each of the following groups. You
will notice that there is a resemblance of meaning between
all the words of each group, but that there is also a shade of
difference in meaning that distinguishes each word from its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
companions. Discover that shade of difference. Use each
word in a sentence.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b><a name="Exercise_140" id="Exercise_140"></a>Exercise 140&mdash;Making a Speech</b></div>

<p>One of the most profitable exercises to cultivate clear
thinking and consequent clear expression is the making of
speeches, usually spoken of as oral themes. In this exercise
a pupil stands before the class to talk upon a subject<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
about which he has thought, but upon which he has written
nothing. He has two objects in view. First, he must
choose those facts that will make his subject clear and interesting
to his audience. Second, he must deliver them well;
that is, he must stand in a good position before the class,
use good grammar, no slang, and enunciate so that every
one in the room can understand him. If his speech is to be
longer than one paragraph, he should have an outline prepared,
in which each division is clearly indicated, as well
as the important details within each division.</p>

<p>In making a speech, the best way is to start with a clear
statement of the subject. Suppose you take (9) below.
You might begin, "I am going to talk of a street car transfer.
First, I shall tell you how it looks; and second, how it is
used. Then first, a street car transfer&mdash;(describe it fully).
In the second place, it is used&mdash;(give details)." After you
have explained fully, to show that you have said all you
intend to say, finish with a sentence of conclusion. <i>Therefore</i>,
<i>consequently</i>, <i>for these reasons</i>, <i>thus we may see</i>, are
instances of words which may be used to begin a sentence
of conclusion.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Use each of the following questions as the subject for a
speech. Answer each question clearly and completely. Use
illustrations to show exactly what you mean.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. What does it mean to be a hero?</p>

<p>2. What does it mean to be successful?</p>

<p>3. What does it mean to be unfortunate?</p>

<p>4. What does it mean to be generous?</p>

<p>5. What does it mean to be lenient?</p>

<p>6. What does it mean to be mercenary?</p>

<p>7. What does it mean to be diffident?</p>

<p>8. What does it mean to be penurious?</p>

<p>9. What is a street car transfer? How does it look and how
is it used?</p>

<p>10. What occupation do you wish to follow, and why? What
preparations are you making?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>11. Why do we have a smoke ordinance?</p>

<p>12. Why must buildings have fire escapes?</p>

<p>13. Why do the farmers of Kansas insure their barns against
cyclones?</p>

<p>14. What is fire insurance?</p>

<p>15. Why is ventilation important?</p>

<p>16. Why do so many immigrants come to this country?</p>

<p>17. Why do cities grow?</p>

<p>18. Why was the steam engine an important invention?</p>

<p>19. Why was the telephone an important invention?</p>

<p>20. What is the principle of vaccination?</p>

<p>21. What is the principle of anti-toxin?</p>

<p>22. Of what good is the trade union to the laborer?</p>

<p>23. Why does the employer object to the union?</p>

<p>24. What is a monopoly?</p>

<p>25. What is meant by a corner in wheat?</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 141</b></div>

<p>In your neighborhood you have frequently noticed a lawn
and a garden that are very poorly kept, the garden needing
weeding and the lawn both weeding and mowing. Imagine
that you go to the owner to make him a proposition. You
know the man slightly, and you have heard that he has a
quick temper. Know exactly what work you will offer to
do and how often you will do it. Be careful of your first
sentences. Let them be especially courteous, so that you
may not offend the gentleman by suggesting that he does
not take care of his property. Tell him frankly that you
would like to earn some money.</p>

<p>In this exercise the class will represent the owner. Moreover,
they will watch carefully so that they may point out
to the speaker wherein his speech was not quite courteous
or not quite clear.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 142</b></div>

<p>From one of the newspapers cut an advertisement of a
position for which you think you can apply. Bring the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
advertisement with you and convince the class that you
are fitted for the position.</p>

<p>In this exercise you must be exact. Choose an advertisement
for a kind of work about which you know something.
If you have ever had any experience that would fit you for
the position, do not fail to tell of it, since experience counts
for much in the employer's estimate of an applicant.</p>

<p>Let the class judge whether the speaker has been convincing
and whether he has shown the properly courteous
attitude toward an employer. Let them ask themselves
such questions as: Is he alert in his manner? Does he make
one feel that he is capable? Does he stand and talk as if
he has confidence in himself? Is he too meek? Does he
seem over-confident? Let each be able to offer suggestions
for improvement.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 143</b></div>

<p>Imagine that you are an agent. Choose an article that is
especially useful to housekeepers. Try to sell it to the class,
or choose an individual member to whom you wish to sell
it. Bring a sample with you for the purpose of demonstrating
its usefulness.</p>

<p>As in the preceding exercise the speaker must strive to
be convincing. He must know all there is to be known about
the article that he is demonstrating. If it is at all possible,
he should have used it in order that he may explain exactly
how it is operated and why it is better than a similar article
that the housekeeper probably is at present using.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 144</b></div>

<p>You wish to start a business and need a certain amount of
money. Try to convince the instructor or a selected pupil
that you need it.</p>

<p>Be sure that you are able to tell definitely the kind of business
for which you wish the money, where you will start the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
business, why you think that this particular location is good,
when you will be able to return the money, and what security
you can give.</p>

<p>Don't make the mistake of choosing something too big
for a boy or a girl to carry through. Perhaps the following
will be suggestive:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. A newspaper stand.</p>

<p>2. A miniature truck farm in the empty lot next door.</p>

<p>3. A pop corn wagon.</p>

<p>4. A fruit cart or stand.</p>

<p>5. A shoe shining stand.</p>

<p>6. Raising ferns or flowers for sale.</p>

<p>7. Buying vegetables from a farmer and selling them to housewives.</p>

<p>8. Printing business cards and blotters on a small press.</p>

<p>9. Making place cards.</p>

<p>10. Making valentines.</p>

<p>11. Painting holiday postal cards or fancy cards for Christmas,
Easter, Thanksgiving, and the like.</p>

<p>12. Printing on postal cards pretty scenes that you have
photographed perhaps in your town or at a summer resort.</p>

<p>13. Making and selling cakes, doughnuts, and the like.</p>

<p>14. Selling crocheted or embroidered articles.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 148&mdash;Debating</b></div>

<p>A very great asset in business is the ability to see the
truth or the falsity of a statement, and to advance proofs
for or against it. This ability we shall try to acquire through
the practice of debating; that is, through the making of
speeches in which students take opposite sides of the same
subject, trying by the presentation of facts and illustrations
to prove that the side which they represent is the correct
one. The statement that is thus argued is called a <i>proposition</i>.</p>

<p>Debating is excellent practice because it teaches not only
clear-cut reasoning, but also forceful expression. If a debater
fails to make any of his several arguments convincing,
if he introduces irrelevant matter, or, though he has prepared
strong proofs, if he expresses them in incorrect English,
the result will be poor. In working out a debate, therefore,
observe the following carefully:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>1. Know your subject thoroughly. If you have insufficient
knowledge, you cannot be convincing.</p>

<p>2. Understand your point of view exactly and explain it
clearly. If you and your opponent have different ideas of
the word <i>trust</i>, for example, you can never argue on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
subject that concerns the trusts. Define your position first
of all.</p>

<p>3. After you have gathered your facts, study them as a
whole. What three arguments, let us say, stand out clearly
in your mind as being irrefutable because of the strong
proofs you have to back them? These are the ones that you
should use; the rest will probably be of little value. Plan
to give the weakest of the three first, so that your argument
will gain force as you advance.</p>

<p>4. Work out the details of each argument. A mere statement
of each is not enough. It must be supported by many
facts and illustrations.</p>

<p>5. Prepare an outline. It will show you whether your
arguments follow each other clearly, whether you have so
arranged them as to secure climax. (See <a href="#Exercise_152">Exercise 152</a>.)</p>

<p>6. In talking, follow the plan explained in <a href="#Exercise_140">Exercise 140</a>,
being especially careful in conclusion to summarize the
proofs that you have presented.</p></div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The conclusions that you reach in your arguments must
be based upon statements that are true. In the following,
some of the statements are false, and therefore the conclusions
based upon them are false. Point out wherein
the falsity consists. In others of the following, irrelevant

it is irrelevant.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. We shall forget a great many facts that we learn at school.
Therefore it is useless to learn them.</p>

<p>2. Oil should be used instead of water in sprinkling our
streets, because oil does not evaporate so quickly as water, and
so does not allow the dust to rise. Moreover, as the street must
be cleaned before the oil is laid, there is less dust to rise. When
the oil lies on the streets, it is very sticky, and clings to everyone's
shoes. In this way it is tracked into the houses and stores,
making everything dirty. Therefore I think the streets should
be oiled instead of being watered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Half of the keys would not work on the typewriter that I
used yesterday. This machine will work no better, as it is made
by the same company.</p>

<p>4. Last year September was very warm, and the winter was
extreme. This year September has been very warm, and therefore
the winter will be extreme.</p>

<p>5. My cousin never went to high school, and when he went
to work he earned eight dollars a week. I have gone to high
school for one year. Therefore I shall receive more than eight
dollars a week when I go to work.</p>

<p>6. When you are working, your employer will never ask you
the definition of a noun. Therefore it is unnecessary to know
any grammar.</p>

<p>7. Every one should be punctual in doing his work. If he is
punctual, he will be promoted and earn a larger salary. Money
is a very important item in this world, but it is not everything.
A person must be satisfied with his work so that he can do it
cheerfully; otherwise he will not succeed. Therefore I think
every one ought to be on time.</p>

<p>8. The day is either sunny or it is not sunny. To-day is not
sunny; therefore it is sunny.</p>

<p>9. It always rains when I wear new shoes. I am wearing new
shoes; therefore it will rain to-day.</p></div>

side of the following debate. Wherever possible, definite

<p><i>Resolved</i>, <span class="smcap">That Advertising has Increased the Cost of
Living</span>.</p>

<div class='center'><i>Affirmative</i></div>

<div class='blockquot'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I. Modern advertising is world-wide in extent.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>a</i>) Practically all classes of articles are now extensively advertised.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(1) Food stuffs; e.g., breakfast foods.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(2) Clothing; e.g., men's suits.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(3) Luxuries; e.g., automobiles.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(4) Investments; e.g., real estate.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>b</i>) Every possible medium is used.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(1) Newspapers.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(2) Magazines.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(3) Billboards and street cars.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(4) Circulars and booklets.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">II. An enormous amount of money is spent in advertising.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>a</i>) The use of advertising agencies is growing more widespread.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(1) One agency has made the statement that it has nine men whose salaries amount to $227,000 annually.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>b</i>) More and more companies are engaging advertising managers.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(1) They draw large salaries.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">(<i>x</i>) In many cases, $10,000 annually.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>c</i>) Advertising rates are very high; for example,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(1) The rate for a certain magazine is $1000 a page per issue.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(2) Metropolitan newspapers charge as high a rate as $500 a page per issue.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>d</i>) Many advertisers use each issue of a number of mediums, making the cost run to an enormous total; for example,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(1) <i>Cream of Wheat</i> is advertised in every issue of almost every magazine.</span><br />
III. The consumer pays for the advertising.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>a</i>) The price that the consumer pays for an article must cover the cost of production and the expense of distribution, leaving</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">fair margins of profit, since</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(1) The manufacturer will no longer produce if his profit ceases.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(2) He is not willing to take the cost of advertising from his profit in manufacturing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(3) The dealer will not take the advertising cost from his own profit.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">IV. Advertising increases prices.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>a</i>) The cost of manufacture and the expense of distribution have been steadily lowered, and yet prices of articles have steadily</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">advanced; therefore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(1) The rise is not due to the cost of manufacture.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(2) Nor to the expense of distribution.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>b</i>) Competition necessitates an increased amount of advertising.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(1) If one firm begins to advertise, its competitors, for self-protection, must follow suit.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>c</i>) Competitive advertising raises expenses above the point where there is a fair profit at the old price.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(1) For a given kind of goods there is usually a certain volume of business, which grows with population.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(2) If all the firms competing in those goods increase their expenses by advertising, they must raise prices to make the same</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">profit as previously.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>d</i>) Advertised articles cost more than the unadvertised.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(1) Bulk rolled oats vs. package rolled oats.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(2) Bulk pickles and relishes vs. advertised brands.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(3) Bulk macaroni vs. package goods.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></div>

<div class='center'><br /><i>Negative</i></div>

<div class='blockquot'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I. The present increased advertising is the result of normal growth.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">(<i>a</i>) Multiplied manufactures necessarily multiply advertisements.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(1) Every day new products are being put on the market.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(2) No product has the chance of a sale until it is known.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(3) In the present scope of community life the advertisement is the most convenient means of acquainting consumers with</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">new products.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">(<i>b</i>) Any unusual increase in advertising has a reasonable explanation.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(1) Automobile advertising has increased as the automobile has replaced the wagon and carriage, because of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">(<i>x</i>) Greater convenience.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">(<i>y</i>) Lower operating cost.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(2) Prepared breakfast food advertising has increased as these foods have replaced cooked foods, because of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">(<i>x</i>) Greater convenience.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">II. Increased advertising is done on the scale of old prices.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">(<i>a</i>) Merchants dare not raise prices to make the consumer pay for the advertising, since</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(1) They must compete with manufacturers who do not advertise and who have no overhead advertising expense.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">(<i>b</i>) The most widely advertised articles are the inexpensive necessary accessories.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(1) Food products.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(2) Soaps and soap powders.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(3) Toilet articles.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">(<i>c</i>) They have not advanced in price.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(1) Quaker Oats.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(2) Ivory Soap; Sapolio.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(3) Mennen's Talcum Powder.</span><br />
III. Widespread advertising works to the advantage, not the disadvantage, of the consumer.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">(<i>a</i>) It gives new opportunities</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(1) To compare values.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(2) To buy to the best advantage; for example,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">(<i>x</i>) In advertised bargain sales.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">(<i>b</i>) It reduces the cost of production and the selling expense, thu tending to lower the price.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(1) By increasing sales, it reduces the cost per article.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">(<i>x</i>) Maximum purchasing power means minimum cost to the manufacturer.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(2) In taking the place of salesmen, it reduces expenses, thus lowering the price; for example,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">(<i>x</i>) In mail order firms.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(3) Therefore the advertising expense is unimportant in influencing a higher price.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">IV. The most marked price advances have been in the unadvertised necessaries of life.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">(<i>a</i>) In breadstuffs.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(1) Less in quantity for higher prices than formerly.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">(<i>b</i>) In meats and poultry.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(1) An advance of from 25 per cent to 100 per cent and more.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">(<i>c</i>) In butter and eggs.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(1) An advance similar to that shown in meats and poultry.</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHOOSING SUBJECTS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> <a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chapter X</a> definite subjects were assigned for talks.
Getting a subject for yourself sometimes seems difficult;
you are likely to think that there is no topic upon which
you can say more than a few sentences. Isn't it true that
when you are talking to your friends you seldom are at a
loss for something to say? Of course, what your companion
says often suggests an idea on which you give your opinion.
You speak about things that interest you, and the words
come fairly easily. Why not apply the same principle to
more formal composition, whether oral or written? Unless
a subject interests you, do not use it. But be careful that
you do not reject it as uninteresting until you have thought
about it carefully, considering it from all sides. Often one
subject will suggest another akin to it, but more interesting
to you because you know more about it. For this reason
choose very simple subjects, and become thoroughly familiar
with them by thinking or reading about them, before you
attempt to explain them.</p>

<p>Sometimes, again, you will find that the subject you have
chosen is not good because it is not definite enough. You
hardly know where or how to begin to explain it, because
it suggests no definite ideas. Perhaps, for instance, you
have decided to write on the automobile and can think
of nothing to say until you remember that you once
saw an automobile race about which you can tell several
interesting details; or you have seen an automobile accident
and can write on the topic <i>A Runaway Electric</i>. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
you can speak or write on a topic taken from your own
observation, your composition will probably be good. You
know the facts, you have an interest in the subject, and you
will very likely say something of interest to others. Subjects
taken from school life or neighborhood happenings,
especially such things as you yourself have seen, are
excellent. Perhaps on your way to school you noticed that
several old houses are being torn down. You remember
that you heard that a candy factory is to be erected. At
once several suggestions for themes will come to you; as,
<i>Why the Factory is Being Erected in this Neighborhood</i>, <i>How
Neighborhoods Change in a Large City</i>, <i>The Work the Wrecking
Company Carries on</i>. Perhaps your father owns property
in the neighborhood, and you could write on <i>How Real
Estate Values have Changed in this Neighborhood</i>.</p>

<p>Next to your own experience, the best source from which
to draw subjects is your reading. This may be divided into
(1) books, (2) magazines and newspapers. Recall one of
the books that you read in the grammar grades, perhaps
<i>The Courtship of Miles Standish</i>. Drawing your material
from this source, you can write <i>A Picture of Early Plymouth
Days</i>, or a sketch of Miles Standish's character, using the
title <i>Practice What You Preach</i>. But to try to tell the whole
story to any one in two or three minutes would result in
failure, for it would be a subject entirely too big to treat
in so short a time. All the interesting details would have
to be omitted, and, if the details are omitted, the story loses
its vitality.</p>

<p>It is the newspaper or the magazine, however, that offers
us the most available source of subjects. Practically all
that we know of the modern world and of the wonderful
progress being made in invention and discovery, as well as
of the accidents and disasters that take place, we have
learned first from the newspaper and have verified later
by the articles in magazines. Every issue of a newspaper or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of a magazine contains suggestions for many subjects. Such
magazines as <i>The World's Work</i>, <i>System</i>, <i>The Outlook</i>, <i>The
Technical World</i>, and other magazines that deal with technical
subjects in a popular way are excellent for this work.</p>

<p>A third important source of subjects is the studies that
you are now pursuing. Every new study affords a new
point of view, which should suggest many topics for oral
and written themes. Sometimes a good subject is the comparison
of two of your studies by which you try to show,
perhaps, how the one depends on the other.</p>

<p>The subject, of course, is but the beginning of the composition.
Developing the subject is fully as important as
having a subject to develop. The ability to develop a subject
clearly is very important in the business world. A
business man sells his goods either by talking or by writing;
by the salesman or by the letter and the advertisement.
Unless the salesman talks in a convincing way, he probably
will sell few goods. He must know not only what to say,
but how to say it.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 154&mdash;The Subject as a Whole</b></div>

<p>First, you must see your subject in its entirety, as one
thing. Ask yourself, "Just what does my title mean?"
and if you have not as yet selected a title, study your subject
from all sides until you can see how to narrow it to
certain definite dimensions. Now you have set a sort of
fence around your subject. Nothing outside must enter,
but nothing inside must escape. The length of the composition
you are to write usually helps you decide on the
limits of your subject. If you are writing a book on Africa,
you might include all that the title suggests to you of exploration,
colonization, civilization, and Christianization. But
if you are writing a very short theme&mdash;not over three
pages&mdash;it is evident that the subject must be narrowed.
Would <i>The Transvaal</i> be good? <i>The Jungles of Africa?</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
<i>Roosevelt in Africa?</i> <i>African Mission Stations?</i> <i>When I
think of Africa I think of Stanley?</i></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Which of the following subjects would be good for short
compositions, either oral or written? The oral theme should
occupy two or three minutes, the written perhaps three
pages. What is the objection to a one word subject?</p>


<div class='center'>

</table></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b><a name="Exercise_155" id="Exercise_155"></a>Exercise 155&mdash;The Divisions of the Subject</b></div>

<p>After you have selected your subject, decide into what
divisions it naturally falls. If it is of the proper length, it
probably will divide itself into two or three divisions. Each
of these will constitute one-half or one-third of your composition,
and within each division illustrations, reasons, and
explanatory details will appear. Arrange the divisions in
the order in which they naturally come, according to their
relative time of happening or according to their relative
importance, reserving the most important for the last.</p>

<p>Sometimes this sort of division is difficult to make, because
a subject can frequently be treated from different points of
view, the point of view deciding the divisions. Sometimes
you will find that you have made a number of small divisions,
in each of which you can say only one or two sentences.
This will at once suggest that you have not found the main
parts of the subject, but have made unimportant divisions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Again, it may seem that you cannot divide your subject
into satisfactory parts. In that case, you probably do not
know enough about it. Think about it again, and, if you
find that you really cannot divide it, choose another.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Choose one of the following subjects. Is the title definite
and clear? If it is not, change it so that it will be. For
example, <i>Photography</i> (5) is not a definite title. No one
could attempt to explain the entire subject of photography
in a few minutes. A better title for a theme would be one
of the following: <i>How to Develop a Negative;</i> <i>How to Intensify
[</i>or<i> reduce] a Negative;</i> <i>Our Camera Club;</i> <i>The Photography

<p>After having selected your title, decide into what divisions
the subject naturally falls. For example, let us take (2)
below. <i>A Ball Game</i> is not a definite title. Instead, let us
choose <i>Last Saturday's Football Game</i>. As stated above, a
subject may be treated from different points of view, the
point of view deciding the divisions. Thus, in treating
<i>Last Saturday's Football Game</i>, we may divide:</p>


<div class='center'><i>a</i><br />

<p>Still other divisions may be made if we consider the subject
from the point of view of the teams or the players themselves.
Can you suggest any such divisions?</p>

<p>In the same way choose one of the subjects given below.
Change it, if necessary. Then write out the topic of each
division in as few words as possible.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 156&mdash;The Outline</b></div>

<p>If your theme consists of more than one division, before
you begin to speak or write you should prepare a definite
working plan or outline. It should include enough to
suggest the first sentence of each division and the more
important details within each. The outline will help you
in speaking or writing to arrange the topics so that they
will follow one another clearly. If you have an outline,
there will be much less danger of including details which
do not belong to the subject and of omitting details which
should appear.</p>

<p>In the following very simple outlines notice the use of
indentation:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>
1<br />

<span class="smcap">The Problem of Keeping our Cities Clean</span><br />
</div><div class='blockquot2'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I. The cleaning of streets.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(1) Outdoor and indoor games.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">(2) Bathing at beaches connected with gymnasiums.</span><br />
</div>

<p>One more suggestion is in place here. In writing an
outline, be careful that you express similar subdivisions of
a topic by similar grammatical elements. For example, in
the first outline above, (<i>a</i>) under I is a phrase; (<i>b</i>) under I
should be a similar phrase. It would be incorrectly worded
<i>Winter</i> or <i>What the winter problem is</i>. What is the advantage
of such similarity?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Using the divisions you made for one of the subjects under
<a href="#Exercise_155">Exercise 155</a>, develop an outline for a theme.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 158</b></div>

<p>Recall one of the books that you have read recently.
Name two subjects that it suggests to you and that you
can talk about. Write a careful outline for each of them,
and be prepared to speak on one.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 159</b></div>

<p>Name a subject taken from one of your studies, history
for example. Let it be definite enough so that you can tell
all the details that you know about it in a speech lasting
two or three minutes. Use examples and illustrations to
make the subject interesting and clear. Prepare an outline.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 160</b></div>

<p>Reproduce an article that you have read in a current
magazine. Be careful that you make the material your
own before attempting to retell it. Do not under any
circumstances try to memorize the article. Understand
fully what it says, make an outline of the facts that you
wish to reproduce, and then give them as if they were your
own ideas. At the beginning of your speech tell the name
and date of the magazine from which you are taking the
facts.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 161</b></div>

<p>As has been said, most of us get our ideas of what is
taking place in the world from the articles that we read in
current newspapers and magazines. We cannot always form
our opinion from what one newspaper on one day says of a
particular event. We must read what it says on successive
days and, if possible, consult other newspapers on the same
subject, for it is well known that not all newspapers are
non-partisan. If one in the city is known to be so, that is
the paper to read for the material for this exercise. Then,
if we can read what one of the magazines says on the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
subject, our knowledge will probably be more definite and
more nearly true.</p>

<p>Let the class be divided into different sections, representing
different kinds of news; for example, national,
local, foreign, and business news. Under national news,
you can perhaps find articles on national politics, legislative
measures being discussed at Washington, rumors of
war, immigration; under local news, anything pertaining
to the city or the state in which you live; under foreign
news, anything of interest to any of the other countries of
the world; under business news, the prices of food products,
strikes, panics, and their effect on business conditions.
These are but suggestions. Such topics change so rapidly
that nothing more definite can here be given.</p>

<p>When you have been assigned to one of these divisions,
prepare a talk on a topic that you understand thoroughly.
Begin your talk with a clear statement of your subject, as
explained in <a href="#Exercise_140">Exercise 140</a>; amplify it by details or illustrations;
and end with a sentence of conclusion, forecasting
the future of your topic or restating what you have proved.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 162</b></div>

<p>For a week follow the same current event as recorded in
the newspaper, taking notes as you read. Then choose
from all your material only those facts that belong strictly
to one topic. Write an outline, setting forth the facts in
logical order. Deliver the speech, following your outline
closely.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 163</b></div>

<p>Let the class choose four or six members one week in
advance, who are to prepare a debate on a topic of current
interest. Let the other members of the class act as judges
or volunteer on either side, as the instructor may see fit.
Such debates should occur as often as possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 164</b></div>

<p>About once a month devote a day to the production of a
class paper. Let the class choose a name. During the
first year let the items be developed into paragraphs. Longer
compositions should be reserved for the second year.</p>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Suggestions for Articles for the Paper</span></div>

<div class='blockquot2'>
1. A column of interesting business items clipped from leading papers.<br />
2. An important news item that would make a good "story."<br />
3. Original editorials on one or more of the following:<br />

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PUNCTUATION</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we speak, we make our meaning clear by the expression
that we put into our words and sentences. Some sentences
we say all in one breath and with not much change in
emphasis from one word to the next. We may be pretty
sure that such a sentence is short and simple, with all its
elements arranged in their natural order. In this respect
compare the sentences given below.</p>

<p>Notice that the following sentence is spoken as one word
group:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Steam and electricity are making one commercial community
of all nations.</p></div>

<p>A part that is subordinate in idea is subordinate in tone;
as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Steam and electricity, <i>which are the greatest of all discoveries</i>,
are making one commercial community of all nations.</p></div>

<p>In the usual order of the sentence the subject comes first.
Sometimes for emphasis a participial phrase or an adverbial
clause precedes the subject. Such inversion is always
indicated; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>If the grape crop is large</i>, the price of grapes is low.</p></div>

<p>Sometimes a word or phrase is thrust into the sentence
to give clearness or force; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If, <i>on the other hand</i>, the season is poor, the price of grapes is
high.</p>

<p>What, <i>then</i>, determines the price of grapes?</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>We cannot become good speakers until we learn to subordinate
in tone those groups of words that are subordinate in
idea, and to bring out clearly those groups which, for one
reason or another, are emphatic. The same thing is true
in music. We cannot become good musicians until we learn
phrasing; that is, until we learn to group the notes to form
distinct musical ideas. But when we write our thoughts,
we cannot indicate the tone in which the words are spoken.
We must show in some other way which groups of words
belong together, which are important, and which are subordinate
in idea. For this purpose punctuation marks have
been invented. When we write, we unconsciously speak
the thoughts to ourselves; we hear the divisions between
the parts of ideas; and, if we understand punctuation, we
indicate the divisions.</p>


<div class='center'><b>Questions</b></div>

<p>1. Why in writing and printing do we separate one word
from the next? In ancient writing this was not done.</p>

<p>2. Why do we separate one sentence from the next?</p>

<p>3. We use punctuation marks for the same reason. Explain.</p>

<p>4. The word to keep in mind in punctuation is <i>separate</i>.
If two words belong together in idea, the two making one
idea, allow them to stand unseparated. If they give two
ideas, separate them by a mark of punctuation. What is
the difference in thought in the two sentences that follow?</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
(<i>a</i>) She is a pretty, energetic girl.<br />
(<i>b</i>) She is a pretty energetic girl.<br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 166&mdash;The Apostrophe (')</b></div>

<p>The <i>apostrophe</i> (') is used&mdash;</p>

<p>1. To show the possessive case of nouns (See <a href="#Exercise_82">Exercise 82</a>);
as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The <i>boy's</i> writing is excellent.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>2. To indicate the omission of one or more letters; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>I'll</i> attend to the matter.</p></div>

<p>3. To show the plural of letters, figures, and words that
usually have no plural; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Your <i>3's</i> are too much like your <i>5's</i>, your <i>a's</i> like your <i>u's</i>.</p>

<p>Don't use so many <i>and's</i>.</p></div>

<p>2. To indicate an abbreviation; as,</p>

<div class="center">The firm of Clark Bros. has opened a new office at 144 Pleasant

his thought to be understood is the punctuation. The
same words may express different ideas according to the

by each. Explain the circumstances under which each might

<div class='center'><br /><b><a name="Exercise_169" id="Exercise_169"></a>Exercise 169&mdash;Quotation Marks (" ")</b></div>

<p>1. When a speaker's words are quoted exactly, they should
be enclosed in quotation marks. This is called a <i>direct
quotation</i>.</p>

<div class="center">He said, "The business is growing."</div>

<p>Notice that the word <i>said</i> is followed by a comma, and that
the quotation begins with a capital letter.</p>

<p>2. If the quotation itself is a question, although it forms
part of a declarative sentence, it requires an interrogation
mark before the quotation mark; as,</p>

<div class='center'>
Have you been waiting long?<br />
She opened the door and said, "Have you been waiting long?"<br />
</div>

<p>3. The same applies to a quotation that requires an
exclamation mark; as,</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Exclamation mark examples">
<tr><td align='left'>Look!</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>He cried, "Look!"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>4. When the words of explanation follow the quoted
words, the punctuation is as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) When the quotation is a declarative sentence, put a
comma after the quotation and begin the words of explanation
with a small letter; as,</p>

<div class="center">"The business is growing," he said.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) When the quotation is a question, conclude it with an
interrogation mark, and begin the words of explanation with
a small letter; as,</p>

<div class="center">"Have you been waiting long?" she asked.</div>

<p>(<i>c</i>) When the quotation is an exclamation, conclude it with
an exclamation mark, and begin the words of explanation
with a small letter; as,</p>

<div class="center">"Look!" he cried.</div>

<p>5. When the author's words of explanation interrupt the
speaker's words, the punctuation is as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) When the interrupted parts are not naturally separated
by any punctuation mark, the comma is used as follows:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Section 5">
<tr><td align='left'>I do not believe that the report is true.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>"I do not believe," he said, "that the report is true."</td></tr>
</table></div>

<div class='unindent'>Notice in what way the quotation marks show that the
words <i>he said</i> do not belong to the quoted words.</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Whatever mark of punctuation would naturally appear
between the interrupted parts must be used; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) I shall buy the Boston ferns; they seem to require but little care.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"I shall buy the Boston ferns," she said; "they seem to require but little
care."</span></p>

<p>(2) Oh! The flames are higher!</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Oh!" she cried. "The flames are higher!"</span></p></div>

<p>4. Division into sentences is made within a quotation
just as elsewhere. When the thought ends, the sentence
must end. The different sentences, however, must not be
divided by quotation marks; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The train came in," said he, "half an hour ago. I do not
see them in the waiting room. I think they did not come."</p></div>

<p>5. When a quotation is very long, consisting of several
paragraphs, quotation marks should be placed at the beginning
of the quotation, at the beginning of each succeeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
paragraph, and at the end of the quotation&mdash;not at the end
of each paragraph.</p>

<p>6. When a quotation occurs within a quotation, the one
within is distinguished by single marks; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>John explained, "After I had told Mr. Brown how I thought
the work could be done more easily, he said, 'Thank you for your
suggestion.'"</p></div>

<p>7. Any words quoted from a book or article, or any words
quoted with a special significance, such as slang, should be
enclosed in quotation marks; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The day of the salesman who is satisfied with the "good old
way" is fast passing.</p></div>

<p>8. A formal question, statement, or resolution for a debate
is not enclosed in quotation marks; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The question we are to discuss is, Shall women vote?</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 170</b></div>

<p>Punctuate the following, dividing into sentences wherever
the sense demands division:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Thank you for your suggestion said Mr. Brown</p>

<p>2. Mr. Brown said thank you for your suggestion</p>

<p>3. Thank you said Mr. Brown for your suggestion</p>

<p>4. If you will ask the shipping clerk I volunteered I think
you can get definite information</p>

<p>5. How can we enforce the law asked the man</p>

<p>6. The law cried the man how can we enforce the law</p>

<p>7. Tell me said the man how we can enforce the law</p>

<p>8. Tell me this said the man how can we enforce the law</p>

<p>9. The question before us is how can we enforce the law</p>

<p>10. John whispered did you hear his mother say yes you may
go</p>

<p>11. As I was walking along the river he continued I heard a
voice cry help</p>

<p>12. Halt shouted the captain the bridge is down</p>

<p>13. The captain shouted halt the bridge is down</p>

<p>14. We cannot cross said the captain the bridge is down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>15. The bridge is down said the captain and I fear there is no
other way to cross</p>

<p>16. Is the bridge down asked the captain does no one know
another way to cross</p>

<p>17. The captain said the bridge is down do you know another
way to cross</p>

<p>18. What shall we do asked a soldier if the bridge is down</p>

<p>19. Do cried the captain swim that's what we'll do</p>

<p>20. As we were riding along spoke up one of the soldiers I heard
a farmer shout you fellows better try the bridge lower down</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 171&mdash;Indirect Discourse</b></div>

<p>In the preceding exercise we saw different forms of direct
quotations, or direct discourse. In each case, the speaker's
words were quoted exactly. When the substance of the
thought is given in slightly different form, we have an
indirect quotation, or indirect discourse, in which no quotation
marks are used. An indirect quotation is usually a
subordinate clause depending on a word of <i>thinking</i>, <i>saying</i>,
<i>telling</i>, or the like. Indirect statements are usually introduced
by <i>that</i>, and indirect questions by <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>, <i>why</i>,
<i>whether</i>, <i>if</i>, <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>what</i>, and the like. When a sentence
is changed from direct to indirect discourse, the person and
usually the tense of the direct quotation are changed; as,</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<i>Direct:</i> He said, "I do not believe the report."<br />
<i>Indirect:</i> He said that he did not believe the report.<br />
<br />
<i>Direct:</i> He said, "Germany is over-populated."<br />
<i>Indirect:</i> He said that Germany is over-populated. (See <a href="#Exercise_107">Exercise 107</a>.)<br />
<br />
<i>Direct:</i> She said, "I did my work before I went to school."<br />
<i>Indirect:</i> She said that she had done her work before she went to school.<br />
<br />
<i>Direct:</i> "I have finished my work," said the girl.<br />
<i>Indirect:</i> She says that she has finished her work.<br />
<br />
<i>Direct:</i> "Why didn't he succeed?" I asked.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span><i>Indirect:</i> I asked why he had not succeeded.<br />
<br />
<i>Direct:</i> "When may I go?" she inquired.<br />
<i>Indirect:</i> She inquired when she might go.<br />
</div>

<p>In the following change the italicized parts to direct quotations.
Do not change the paragraphing.</p>

<div class='center'>1<br />

<span class="smcap">The Seal's Lesson</span></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The baby seal said <i>that he could not swim</i>.</p>

<p>His mother answered <i>that he could try</i>.</p>

<p>The little fellow persisted <i>that he could never learn</i>.</p>

<p>His mother looked at him sternly, and said <i>that every seal
must learn to swim</i>.</p>

<p>He replied <i>that the water was cold and that he liked the sand
better</i>, but because his mother insisted, he slid into the water
whimpering.</p>

<p>After he had gone a short distance, he turned around and called
out <i>that the water was much pleasanter than the sand</i>.</p>

<p>His mother said <i>that she knew that it would be so</i>. She said
<i>that young people must do as they are told because they have not
had enough experience to judge for themselves</i>.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />2<br />

<span class="smcap">A Faithful Servant</span></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A certain old time king said <i>that he needed a servant who could
be depended upon</i>. He said he knew <i>that such a man is difficult to
secure, and in the hope of getting the right one, he would hire two</i>.</p>

<p>When he had engaged them, he took them to a well and, showing
them a large basket, told them <i>to fill it with water</i>. He said
<i>that he would return at night to see what they had done</i>.</p>

<p>The men were very much in earnest when they began the work,
but, after pouring five or six bucketfuls of water into the basket,
one of them stopped and said <i>that he did not see any use in doing
that because, as soon as he poured the water in, it ran out again,
and his time was lost</i>.</p>

<p>His companion replied <i>that the kind of work that their master
gave them was no concern of theirs; that they were paid to do the
work; and, whether it seemed useful to them or not, they ought to
do it</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>
<p>The first speaker said <i>that the other man could do as he pleased,
but, as for him, he did not expect to waste his time on such foolish
work</i>. Throwing his bucket down, he walked off.</p>

<p>The one that was left continued at the work until about sunset,
when he had nearly emptied the well. Looking into the basket,
he saw something glittering. Stooping to look more closely, he
found in the basket a ring of great value which his bucket had
scooped up from the mud at the bottom of the well. He said
<i>that now he knew why the king had wanted the water poured into
the basket</i>.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, when the king came up with some of his
officers and saw the ring in the basket, he knew that the man
had obeyed him, and he said <i>that he knew he could trust him,
and as a reward for obedience he would make him master over other
servants</i>.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 172&mdash;The Paragraph in Dialogue</b></div>

<p>In conversation the words of each speaker, together with
the author's words of explanation, form one paragraph.
Whenever the speaker changes, the paragraph changes; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mimer," boldly said the god Odin to the gray old guardian
of the well where wit and wisdom lie hidden, "Mimer, let me
drink of the waters of wisdom."</p>

<p>"Truly, Odin," answered Mimer, "it is a great treasure that
you seek and one which many have sought before but who,
when they knew the price of it, turned back."</p>

<p>Then replied Odin, "I would give my right hand for wisdom
willingly."</p>

<p>"Nay," rejoined the remorseless Mimer, "it is not your right
hand, but your right eye, you must give."&mdash;Keary: <i>The Heroes
of Asgard</i>.</p></div>

<p>However, when one speaker talks at length, what he says
is formed into paragraphs according to the divisions into
which it falls. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">Chapter XIV</a>.)</p>

<p>When a short quotation is simply part of a paragraph, it
is punctuated as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This, however, was of use to me, the impression continuing on
my mind. Often when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
thing, I said to myself, "Don't give too much for the whistle,"
and I saved my money.</p></div>

<p>Paragraph the following:</p>

<div class='center'>1</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On the next morning we had gone but a mile or two when we
came to an extensive belt of woods, through the midst of which
ran a stream, wide, deep, and of an appearance particularly
muddy and treacherous. In plunged the cart, but midway it
stuck fast. Then approached the long team and heavy wagon
of our friends, but it paused on the brink. "Now my advice
is,&mdash;" began the captain, who had been anxiously contemplating
the muddy gulf. "Drive on!" cried R. But Wright, the
muleteer, apparently had not as yet decided the point in his own
mind. He sat still in his seat on one of the shaft-mules, whistling
in a low, contemplative strain to himself. "My advice is," resumed
the captain, "that we unload; for I'll bet any man five
pounds that if we try to go through, we shall stick fast." "By
the powers, we shall stick fast!" echoed Jack, the captain's brother,
shaking his large head with an air of conviction. "Drive on!
drive on!" petulantly cried R. "Well," observed the captain,
turning to us as we sat looking on, "I can only give my advice;
and if people won't be reasonable, why, they won't, that's all!"&mdash;Parkman:
<i>The Oregon Trail</i>.</p></div>

encounter, but there was nothing to do except explain her
presence; so she asked, "Is the lady of the house at home?." "I
am the lady of the house at present," said the stranger with a
whimsical smile. "What can I do for you?" "Have you ever
heard of the&mdash;would you like&mdash;er I mean, do you need any

<p>Change the following from indirect to direct discourse and
paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When Whittier went on his first fishing trip, it was a day in
early summer. The long afternoon shadows lay cool on the
grass. The boy said that the flowers seemed brighter and the
birds merrier than ever before. When they came to a bend in
the river, his uncle said that this was a good place to try. He
told the boy to throw out his line as he had seen others do and
move it on the surface of the water in imitation of the leap of a
frog. The boy did as he was told, but he caught no fish. His
uncle said that he should try again. Suddenly the bait sank out
of sight, and the boy cried out that he had caught a fish at last.
As he spoke, he pulled up a tangle of weeds. His uncle said that
he should try again, because fishermen must have patience. In
a moment the boy felt something tug at his line, and as he jerked
it up, he saw a fine pickerel wriggling in the sun. In uncontrollable
excitement he called out to his uncle, telling him to look
at the big pickerel. His uncle said that the boy didn't have
it yet, and as he spoke there was a splash in the water, and the
boy's hook hung empty. His uncle assured him that there were
more fish in the river, but the boy would not be comforted. His
uncle smiled shrewdly and told Whittier to remember never to
brag of catching a fish until it was on dry land. He said that
he had seen older people doing that in more ways than one, and
so making fools of themselves. He said that it was better not to
boast of doing a thing until it was done.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 173&mdash;The Comma (,)</b></div>

<p><b>Rule 1.&mdash;The comma is used to separate a direct quotation
from the words of explanation.</b></p>

<p>For illustration see the foregoing exercises.</p>

<p>Write the following from dictation; then compare your
version with the original:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Literature, the ministry, medicine, the law, and other occupations
are hindered for want of men to do the work. To test this
statement thoroughly you need only hunt up a first-class editor,
reporter, business manager, foreman of a shop, mechanic, or
artist in any branch of industry and try to hire him. You will
find that he is already hired. He is sober, industrious, capable,
reliable, and always in demand. He cannot get a day's holiday
except by courtesy of his employer, or of his city, or of the great
general public. But if you need idlers, shirkers, half-instructed,
unambitious, and comfort-seeking editors, reporters, lawyers,
doctors, and mechanics apply anywhere.&mdash;<i>Mark Twain.</i></p></div>

<p><b>Rule 2.&mdash;The comma is used to separate the members of
a series.</b></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 174</b></div>

<p>Divide the following into sentences and supply the necessary
commas:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Abraham Lincoln was a tall strong powerfully built boy he
could lift a load cut down a tree or build a fence more quickly

showed his wise brain his great courage and his kindness of heart
his character was not made in a day nor a month nor a year it
was built up after years of yearning years of striving and years
of hard work.</p></div>

<p>In the above point out the instances where the comma
is used&mdash;</p>

<p>1. When several nouns follow one another, all being in
the same case.</p>

<p>2. When several adjectives follow one another, all modifying
the same noun.</p>

<p>3. When a succession of phrases modifies the same noun.</p>

<p>This kind of succession is called a <i>series</i>. Each new member
gives a new idea, the comma being used to help the
reader to separate one from the next with ease. Notice that
the comma is used between the last two members before
the co&ouml;rdinate conjunction as well as between the other
members.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>The selections given above illustrate the compound sentence.
Notice the thought expressed in these sentences.
There is usually an idea of balance or contrast, and the two
halves of the sentence express the two halves of the idea.
The two members are usually distinct enough to require
a comma before the conjunction. If the conjunction is
omitted, a semicolon must separate the two members, as in
the second selection above.</p>

<p>When an adverbial clause or a participial adjective phrase
is put at the beginning of a sentence to secure emphasis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
it is called an <i>initial</i> clause or participial phrase. A comma
separates it from the independent clause to help the reader
to see where the subordinate idea ends and where the main
idea begins. Rewrite the following from dictation, noticing
the punctuation of initial elements:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If a city is to be kept in good condition, every citizen must
pay his share of the expense. If the dreadful epidemics are to

their work well, the health of the city improves. In order that
the decrees of the health department and of the courts may be
enforced, there must be a good police department. Besides

Because all of these good things cost a great deal of money, high

are not absolutely necessary. In other words, they might

should be set off by commas so that the reader will
easily see that they are subordinate to the main idea of the

strength of fiber is wanted because of the brilliant finish it gives.
For the manufacture of fine goods including sateens India linens
and mercerized goods as well as for mixing with silk it has been
found very valuable. Cotton growers expect that the enlargement
of the Assouan dam will eventually redeem about a million
acres from the desert in Lower Egypt and although not more than
half will probably be planted to cotton it will increase Egypt's
output about twenty-five per cent. Our Department of Agriculture
after having experimented for years has developed and
acclimated in California a variety of Egyptian cotton superior
several experts say to the real Egyptian. It now rests with the

advantage than in saving good though minor materials that

found it correct for himself but like all principles catering

continue to keep a voice in government, or shall we turn our

Dear Sir:<br />


<p>You are no doubt now planning your summer vacation before
you make any new plans however consider the opportunity that
we are offering you to see a new and marvelously beautiful world
for little more very likely than the cost of an ordinary vacation
at the summer hotel to which you usually go.</p>

<p>The idea of summer travel in the Tropics it may be is new to
you comparatively few people unfortunately have yet awakened
to its possibilities they do not realize at least not fully that the
climate in Jamaica Panama and the Central and South American
countries is practically the same throughout the year moreover
the transportation rates are much lower than they are in the
North and the incidental expenses of travel such as carriage fare
and the cost of curios are considerably less rough weather too is
almost unknown in the summer.</p>

<p>Possibly as you live on the shores of Lake Michigan you have
been considering a week's cruise of the great lakes at an expense
certainly of $40 or more and along coasts that you have seen
doubtless many times before we offer a number of trips varying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
in length from twelve to twenty-four days and in cost from $50
to $130 to Jamaica Panama and Central and South America thus
for ten dollars more you may sail twice as long pass shores much
more beautiful visit cities far more strange and return with a
new almost magical store of memories.</p>

<p>You are wondering perhaps how it is that we can offer these
remarkably low rates the reason briefly told is that our ships
carry an exceptionally large amount of freight however do not
think merely because our ships carry freight that they are not
splendidly equipped for passenger travel on the other hand they
are so luxuriously furnished that they are especially fitted for
tropical cruises you are missing an unusual opportunity we assure
you if you do not more fully investigate our offer.</p>

<p>D. The <i>explanatory relative clause</i>.</p>

<p>Similar to the appositive is the explanatory relative clause.
Like an appositive, it is inserted into the sentence for the
purpose of explanation and is separated from the rest of the
sentence by commas. Because of this similarity, it is sometimes
called an appositive relative clause.</p>

<p>Great care must be taken in punctuation to distinguish
a clause that may be omitted from the sentence without
destroying the meaning from one that may not be omitted.
The appositive clause may be omitted. A restrictive clause,
because it restricts the meaning of the word it modifies, may
not be omitted. Because it is needed for the sake of clearness,
it is not separated from the rest of the sentence by commas.
To distinguish an appositive clause from a restrictive
clause, the former is called a non-restrictive clause.</p>

<p>Notice the difference between the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. The Commonwealth Edison Company, <i>which controls the
electric light and power supply of Chicago</i>, was organized in 1907
by the consolidation of the Chicago Edison Company and the
Commonwealth Electric Company.</p></div>

<p>The sentence makes complete sense without the relative
clause.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>2. The concern <i>that controls the electric light and power supply
of Chicago</i> is the Commonwealth Edison Company.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>The relative clause must be used to understand the
sentence.</p>

<p>In (1) the relative clause gives an additional idea. In (2)
it limits or restricts the meaning of <i>the concern</i>. The non-restrictive
clause is shown in (1), the restrictive clause in (2).</p>

<p>Dictation to illustrate non-restrictive clauses:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is estimated that Chicago annually uses 93,450,000 gallons
of milk, for which it pays over $28,000,000. To supply this
amount 120,000 cows are needed, which are owned by 12,000
dairy farms. Health officers conduct a systematic dairy farm
inspection, which has for its purpose the exclusion of diseased
milk. Farm owners, who formerly objected to the inspection, now
see that cleanliness is profitable. Authorities have discovered
that milk, which easily absorbs germs, is dangerous except when
produced under sanitary conditions, and now dairies are allowed
to sell only clean, pure milk, which is milk given by a healthy
cow.</p></div>

<p>Phrases as well as clauses may be restrictive. In the
following sentences decide whether the italicized expressions
are restrictive or non-restrictive. State whether they
are phrases or clauses. Do any of the sentences need

which is also very dirty on the head of a little peasant child you
may be pretty sure that she is celebrating her birthday by wearing
the family heirloom. These hats which are sometimes willed
to a favorite relative and which in some instances go the round
of the family are considered almost priceless. It is a frequent
sight along the dusty roads outside the little towns to see untidy
old women who are sauntering along twisting twine as they go

<span class="smcap">Trouble in Introducing Steel</span></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Strange as it now seems," said one of Carnegie's "young
men," now the vice-president of a large and prosperous corporation
in New York, "in the early days of the steel industry we had
the greatest difficulty in the world in weaning the old manufacturers
away from the use of wrought iron, though they admitted
the superiority of steel. They would look at it, test it,
and agree that it seemed to possess all the desirable qualities
claimed for it, but it was more or less untried by time, and they
preferred to stick to the old wrought iron, with which they were
familiar.</p>

<p>"I remember one old chap with whom I had wrestled long,
but in vain, coming into my office and picking up a long, soft
steel rivet, which had been bent double and hammered flat.</p>

<p>"'How many did you break in making this?' he asked, picking
it up and examining it curiously.</p>

<p>"'That's the first one we hammered over, and, what is more
to the point, we can do it with all steel of that type,' I replied.</p>

<p>"The polite incredulity in his face stirred my professional
pride, and I said, 'If I let you go to the mills, pick out a dozen of
those rivets just as they come from the rolls, and hammer them
with your own hands, will you use that steel hereafter, if it comes
up to the test?'</p>

<p>"He said he would, and the rest was easy, for it is much easier
not to break than to break that kind of steel. Before long the
old man came back with perspiration dripping from the end of
his nose but with the light of conviction shining in his eye. The
firm had a new customer."</p></div>

power, and Shaw said that it reminded him of a speech he had
made in Seattle in the campaign of 1896.</p>

<p>"I was speaking to a filled hall and had almost finished," said
Shaw, "when a long-whiskered man arose about the middle of
the hall and held up his hand, saying he wanted to ask a question.</p>

<p>"'Go ahead,' I said.</p>

<p>"'How, then, Mr. Speaker, do you explain the unequal distribution
of wealth?' was his question.</p>

<p>"When I answered him with, 'In the same way that I explain
the unequal distribution of whiskers,' bedlam broke loose.</p>

<p>"As soon as I could get quiet restored, I said: 'Now don't
think I returned the answer I did to make fun of your whiskers.
You will observe that I have no whiskers, as I dissipate them by
shaving them off. Nature gives me abundance of whiskers, and,
if I conserved them as you do, I also should be abundantly supplied.
Now, it is the same way with money. The man who
conserves his money has more than his share, as with whiskers;
while the man who dissipates his money is without his allotment.'"</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 190&mdash;The Semicolon (;)</b></div>

<p>The semicolon is used between the propositions of a compound
sentence when no co&ouml;rdinate conjunction is used.
(See <a href="#Exercise_176">Exercise 176</a>, 2.)</p>

<div class="center">It is not work that kills men; it is worry.</div>
<div class='unindent'>It is important not to overdo this use of the semicolon.
Do not use it unless the two principal clauses of the
sentence taken together easily form one idea.</div>

<p>Especial care must be taken not to confuse co&ouml;rdinate
conjunctions and conjunctive adverbs. The following are
conjunctive adverbs: <i>then</i>, <i>therefore</i>, <i>consequently</i>, <i>moreover</i>,
<i>however</i>, <i>so</i>, <i>also</i>, <i>besides</i>, <i>thus</i>, <i>still</i>, <i>otherwise</i>, <i>accordingly</i>.
When they are used to join principal clauses, they should
be preceded by a co&ouml;rdinate conjunction or a semicolon; as,</p>

the development of industry in this country can fail to have
observed that the larger kinds of credit are more and more difficult

efforts with those who already control the industries of the country;
and nobody can fail to observe that any man who tries to set himself
up in competition with any process of manufacture which
has been taken under the control of large combinations of capital
will presently find himself either squeezed out or obliged to sell

in 1890, $24.75; in 1900, $31.78; in 1910, $45.05, and it is steadily
increasing. Remember the fact that the population had increased
from 10,000,000 in 1820 to over 90,000,000 in 1910; the "rainy

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 191&mdash;The Colon (:)</b></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Three things are necessary: intelligence, perseverance, and
tact.</p>

early in the morning.</p></div>

<p>The colon is not used after <i>namely</i>, <i>as</i>, <i>that is</i>, <i>for example,

Ave and 2015 Logan Square.</p>

<p>5. One use of the comma is to set off an appositive for example
Mr Kearne the buyer has left the city.</p>

<p>6. The comma is used to set off an independent adverb as

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 193&mdash;The Dash(&mdash;)</b></div>

<p>The dash is used to set off parenthetical expressions that
have very little connection with the rest of the sentence; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In New York the Harlem River tunnel was comparatively a
simple one, but the first East River tunnels&mdash;the two subway
tubes from the Battery to Brooklyn&mdash;presented all the difficulties
known to subaqueous construction.</p>

building&mdash;another of the same decade's accomplishments&mdash;to
East Thirty-fourth Street.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The dash is also used to indicate a sudden change or break
in the thought; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. When the millennium comes&mdash;if it ever does&mdash;all of our
problems will be solved.</p>

<p>2. "I believe&mdash;" began the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Believe!" interrupted his client. "I don't want you to
believe. I want you to know."</p></div>

<p>The dash is used before a word that summarizes the preceding
part of the sentence; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He had robbed himself of the most precious thing a man can
have in business&mdash;his friends.</p></div>

<p>After a comma the dash has the effect of lengthening the
separation; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>One thing the Puritans desired,&mdash;freedom to worship God.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 194&mdash;Parenthesis Marks ()</b></div>

<p>Parenthesis marks are used to enclose explanatory expressions
that are not an essential part of the sentence; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that
the receipts of cattle at the six leading markets (Chicago, St.
Louis, Kansas City, South Omaha, St. Joseph, and Sioux City)
from January 1 to August 1 of this year are 15 per cent less
than they were in the corresponding period of last year.</p></div>

<p><i>Wrong.</i>&mdash;Do not use parenthesis marks to cancel a word
or a passage. A line should be drawn through a word that is
wrong.</p>

<p>Bring to class five sentences that illustrate the correct
use of parenthesis marks.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 195&mdash;The Hyphen (-)</b></div>

<p>The hyphen is used when a word has been divided. It is
always used at the end of the line and never at the beginning.</p>

<p>When several short words are taken together to form one
word, they are hyphenated; as,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>a one-hundred-pound bag of coffee</p></div>

<p>As a rule, when two words taken together are each accented,
they must be written with the hyphen. When only one is
accented, no hyphen is used; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>follow-up, first-class, self-reliant, railroad, steamship</p></div>

<p>As a rule, nouns which are compounded of a participle
and a noun use the hyphen; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>talking-machine, driving-wheel</p></div>

<p>When fractions are written out, the hyphen is used; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>one-third, three-fifths</p></div>

<p>In other numerals expressing a compound number the
hyphen is also used; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>twenty-one, sixty-six</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 196</b></div>

<p>The change in grape prices affected the Red Peru variety in
which the supply has almost stopped the price being raised from
$1.05 to $1.25 a box. If one may trust the forecast of local merchants
the price will probably remain at this higher point until
the supply is exhausted. Cantaloupes seem to be a trifle scarce
especially the pineapple variety the price of which was raised
from $1.10 to $1.30 a crate. Cauliflower was raised to $1.35

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CLEAR SENTENCE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Business</span> men like to talk of brevity. They tell you that
a talk or a letter must be brief. What they really mean is
that the talk or the letter must be concise; that it must
state the business clearly in the fewest possible words.
Don't omit any essential fact when you write, but don't
repeat. If you can express an idea in ten words, don't use
twenty. In a later exercise we shall meet the sentence,
<i>The size of the crops is always important, and it is especially
so to the farmer, and this is because he has to live by the
crops.</i> The writer of that sentence was very careless. He
had a good idea and thought that, if he kept repeating
it, he would make it stronger. Just the reverse is true.
The sentence may be expressed in a very few words: <i>The
size of the crop is vitally important to the farmer.</i></p>

<p>If you wish to secure conciseness of expression, be especially
careful to avoid joining or completing thoughts by these
expressions: <i>and</i>, <i>so</i>, <i>why</i>, <i>that is why</i>, <i>this is the reason</i>,
<i>and everything</i>.</p>

<p>In this chapter we shall consider some of the larger faults
that should be avoided in sentences.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 197&mdash;Unity of the Sentence</b></div>

<p>Give the definition of a sentence.</p>

<p>How many thoughts may one sentence express?</p>

<p>What is likely to happen when two thoughts are joined
by <i>and?</i> What, then, is the danger in using the compound
sentence?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The compound sentence is good to use to express certain
ideas, especially contrast; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is not work that kills men; it is worry.</p>

<p>It is not the revolution that destroys the machinery, but the
friction [but it is the friction].</p></div>

<p>The sentences which most clearly and easily give us one
thought are the simple and the complex sentences.</p>

<p>Compare the following sentences. Which of them leave
<i>one</i> idea in your mind?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The tongue is a sharp-edged tool.</p>

<p>A sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener with
constant use.</p>

<p>A sharp tongue is like an edged tool, and it grows keener with
constant use.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 198</b></div>

<p>The following is wordy. Rewrite it, condensing as much
as possible. Use simple and complex sentences rather than
compound, expressing in each only one thought.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the early summer the corn crop frequently seems to be very
poor, and so reports begin to circulate that corn will be high in
the autumn, but when the autumn really comes, Wall Street,
that great center of business life, begins to see that the reports
have been greatly exaggerated and that crops really will be very
good, and so business begins to pick up. The size of the crop
largely settles the volume of the next season's business, because
so great a part of the world's business activity is made up of buying
and selling the actual potatoes and corn and wheat and cattle
or the products made from these, and when the crop is poor there
are a great many people concerned, because they will be poor
just as the crops are poor, and this applies to the farmer as well
as to the dealer.</p>

<p>The size of the crops is always important, and is especially so
to the farmer, and this is because he has to live by the crops. A
man may be living in the city and working for a salary and begin
to see that his work is not supporting him, and if he is an ambitious
man, he will change his occupation. This the farmer cannot
do because he has made an enormous investment; in the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
place, he has invested in his land, and then in his seed and farm
implements, and this investment often means all the available
money the farmer has, and often it means a mortgage on his farm.
He puts the mortgage on his farm in hope of getting a good crop,
and when his hope is not realized, he is in trouble, because he
may lose his whole farm if he cannot pay the installments of interest
due on his mortgage; but then, on the other hand, if we consider
the other side of the question, when the crop is large, the
situation is altogether different. Even if the farmer has put a
mortgage on his farm, he gets enough money from his produce
to pay the debt of that mortgage, and he need not worry how he
is to live during the next winter.</p>

<p>The town merchants depend on a good crop, because, if the
farmer has not a good return from his fields, he will have almost
no ready money, and so he cannot buy much clothing or household
furnishings. In Iowa, for instance, there is a little town in the
center of a corn-raising community, and it is here that the farmers
congregate to do their buying, and in this town there is quite
a large department store, and it is run by a woman. She does
most of her buying in the autumn and she prefers to do it personally,
and so she likes to make a trip to New York for the purpose,
but she never sets out until she knows that the corn crop is good.
And the reason for this is that she knows that it will cost her hundreds
of dollars to make the trip East, to stay at a good hotel, and
to spend the requisite length of time choosing her purchases at
the different wholesale houses, and she knows that if there is
no corn crop she will sell very few coats and hats and lace curtains,
and it will never pay her to run up her expenses into the
hundreds of dollars, but she will buy as best she can from the
drummers, and buy only a little, and thus the size of the crop
determines how much the farmer can buy, and, therefore, how
much the wholesale and retail dealers can sell.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 199&mdash;Subordination in the Sentence</b></div>

<p>Sentences containing compound predicates may be made
more direct in thought if one of the verbs is changed to a
participle or an infinitive, because the predicate will then
express only one action; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. The carpenter <i>threw</i> down his hammer <i>and walked</i> out of
the shop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>Throwing</i> down his hammer, the carpenter walked out of
the shop.</p>

<p>3. I <i>went</i> downtown <i>and applied</i> for the position.</p>

<p>4. I went downtown <i>to apply</i> for the position.</p></div>

<p>Change the following sentences so that one action is
denoted by the predicate of each:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. A teamster drove out of the alley east of the theater and
swung his horses directly in front of a Madison street car.</p>

<p>2. The tongue struck the front of the car and bored a hole
in the fuse box.</p>

<p>3. The fire spread and burned the roof of the car.</p>

<p>4. The half dozen passengers were badly frightened and got
out quickly.</p>

<p>5. Several people ran and turned in a fire alarm.</p>

<p>6. In a few minutes the fire engines arrived and began to
fight the flames.</p>

<p>7. Crowds came from all directions and silently watched the
flames.</p>

<p>8. The people poured out of the theater and cheered the firemen.</p>

<p>9. The half dozen passengers soon recovered and stood on the
curbstone in the crowd.</p>

<p>10. The firemen did their work quickly and departed amid
the cheers of the crowd.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 200&mdash;Combination of Short Sentences</b></div>

<p>Sometimes short sentences are bad because two or three
of them are needed to express one complete thought. If
that is the case, they should be combined, the most important
detail being put into the principal clause, and the
other details into modifiers, as in the preceding exercise.</p>

<p>Make use of&mdash;</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
1. Adjectives.<br />
2. Adverbs.<br />
3. Participial phrases.<br />
4. Infinitives.<br />
5. Relative pronouns.<br />
6. Subordinate conjunctions.<br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Below, the first and second sentences together make one
thought, which is expressed in the third.</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
John is a good reporter.<br />
That is why he earns a good salary.<br />
Because John is a good reporter, he earns a good salary.<br />
</div>

<p>Combine the sentences of each group below into a single
sentence, either simple or complex, omitting as many words
as possible but no ideas:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. We stayed at home for two reasons: first of all, we thought
Baltimore might be unpleasantly warm. Then, the other reason
was that we thought we ought to economize.</p>

<p>2. In China the wedding takes place at the bridegroom's
house. This has been decorated with strips of bright red paper,
and they have the word "Hsi" on them. This means "Live in
happiness."</p>

<p>3. First in the procession come the standard bearers. They
are hired for the occasion. These men have red coats put on over
their dirty clothes. The men they hire are usually beggars.</p>

<p>4. Six years ago I went sailing on Lake George with my father.
I was ten years old at that time. Two other men went along with
us. The boat that we went in belonged to my father and these
men.</p>

<p>5. The wind was high and it would come in gusts. This
made it hard to sail. It shifted the sails so quickly that it would
throw the boat over on one side.</p>

<p>6. Several times the boat leaned over at an angle of forty
degrees. This let the water come in on that side. When this
happened, we all had to jump to the other side. We did this so
that the boat would right itself.</p>

<p>7. The heart is the most important organ in the body. This
is because if the heart stops beating, you cannot live. Besides,
all the other organs are connected with it. It is something like
the main spring in a watch.</p>

<p>8. This is a good machine. And since that's the case, I don't
see why it is that it doesn't work as it should.</p>

<p>9. In every business there are many bad debts. Some can
be collected and others cannot be. This is because the men who
made them were given credit, and they didn't have any money.</p>

<p>10. The night was dark, and there were no stars. The fishermen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
stood on the shore, and they gazed at the wild sea. A storm
had arisen, and they could not go out in their boats.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 201</b></div>

<p>As in the preceding exercise, rewrite the following, omitting
as many words as possible, but no ideas. Use shorter,
simpler expressions wherever possible.</p>

<div class='center'>1</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Uncle Sam now has an aerial navy, but it's a small one, and
foundations of it were recently laid. This was done when contracts
were signed for the delivery of three aeroplanes and they
are the first aeroplanes that the United States bought. These
aeroplanes are of the latest development. They are all capable
of rising from land or water. They are able also to land on
water or on the deck of a ship, and they can carry at least one
passenger and are equipped with wireless outfits. Two of them
are Curtis machines and the third is a Wright, and they ranged
in price from $2,700 to $5,500.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />2</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The United States produces more steel than any two European
countries, and it is continuing to produce more. Moreover, it
has the productive capacity to produce more than any other three
or four countries put together. This capacity is being still further
increased. At the present time, there is one very important steel
company. It is very large, and seems to wish to monopolize the
entire iron and steel industry. Even at this time it owns half
the principal plants that are now producing steel and iron, and
controls half the trade of the entire steel and iron industry, and
when such a thing happens, it is a matter of international concern.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />3</div>

<p>Condense the following into a single sentence, either
simple or complex:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The iron and steel industry is very important, and it includes
a great deal. First, the ore has to be mined, and then the work
includes everything up to making the finest wire for musical
instruments. Or, to put it another way, you can say from smelting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the ore to building a battle ship. This is a very interesting
occupation and, as said before, very important. There is hardly
anything more interesting or important except agriculture.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 202&mdash;Dangling Expressions</b></div>

<p>Sometimes a sentence is not clear because it contains a
participle which does not modify anything in the sentence.
A participle is part <i>verb</i> and part <i>adjective</i>. As a verb, it
expresses the idea of the verb from which it is derived. As
an adjective, it must modify a noun or a pronoun. The
important point is that this noun or pronoun must be expressed
in the sentence and not lie in the mind of the writer,
as it does in the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Riding from Saugatuck to Holland last year, the country
showed unmistakable signs of lack of rain.</p></div>

<p>Here the writer means, <i>We saw that the country</i>, etc., but
he says that the country rode from Saugatuck to Holland.</p>

<p>Again, an expression may be used which is really an incomplete
clause. Do not use such a clause, unless the understood
subject is the same as the subject expressed in the
independent proposition.</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
<i>Wrong:</i> When almost exhausted, the camp was reached.<br />
<i>Right:</i> When almost exhausted, we reached the camp.<br />

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 203&mdash;Pronouns with Uncertain Antecedents</b></div>

<p>Sometimes the meaning of a sentence is not clear because
the pronouns have uncertain antecedents.</p>

antecedents; as,</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>

a direct quotation used before the pronouns can be made
clear; as,</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>

<i>Right:</i> <i>a.</i> Tom said, "Father, your suit case is lost."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><i>b.</i> Tom said, "Father, my suit case is lost."</span><br />
</div>

<p>3. Sometimes the pronoun refers to a word that has not
been expressed or to an <i>idea</i>. In that case, the antecedent
must be supplied; as,</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
<i>Wrong:</i> If any one wishes to contribute to the cause, let him send <i>it</i> in the enclosed envelope.<br />
<i>Right:</i> If any one wishes to contribute to the cause, let him send <i>his contribution</i> in the enclosed envelope.<br />

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 206&mdash;Shift in Construction</b></div>

<p>Sometimes the meaning of the sentence is obscure because
there has been a shift in construction. Do not change subject,
person, tense, or any grammatical form without a good
reason. Remember that <i>and</i> is a co&ouml;rdinate conjunction.
If there is an adjective before <i>and</i>, there must be an adjective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
after it. If a clause precedes, a clause must follow.
In other words, <i>and</i> joins two members of exactly the same
structure. <i>And</i> may not join one word and a phrase, nor
may it join a prepositional and a participial phrase. Both
members must be alike. In the following extract, parallel
constructions are used correctly. Be able to tell what kinds
of elements are used and how they are parallel.</p>

they were dependent upon them for spices and luxuries. The
three routes were through the Mediterranean Sea, over the Suez
Peninsula, down the Red Sea, and across to India. Another was
through the Mediterranean and then through Arabia. The other
was from the Mediterranean and then through the Black Sea and
then by land to India. It became necessary to seek a new route
because the Turks held Constantinople, and all vessels had to pass
through the Mediterranean, and the Turks held this by pirates.
The first explorers were working under the leadership of the King
of Portugal, and they solved the problem by going around Africa
and then to the Indies, but this was too long, and so explorers
tried other ways, and the result was the discovery of America.</p></div>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE PARAGRAPH</div>


<p>The sentences developing each of the divisions of a composition
make one <i>paragraph</i>. A paragraph, therefore, is
the treatment of one of the natural divisions of a subject.
The length depends on the topic to be treated. Two cautions
may be given:</p>

<p>1. Do not write paragraphs containing only one sentence.
Such paragraphs do not represent divisions of the subject.
They are simply statements which have not been expanded
as they deserve, or they are sentences that should be
placed with the preceding or succeeding sentences in order
to make a good paragraph. Some business men in their
letters and advertisements use the one-sentence paragraph
too frequently to concentrate the attention of the reader.
A writer divides his composition into paragraphs in order
to aid the reader to follow the thoughts he is presenting.
When the reader sees the indentation that indicates a new
paragraph, he thinks that the writer has said all that he
intends to say on the topic in hand and now intends to
open a new topic. It is confusing to find that the new paragraph
is simply another sentence on the same topic as the
preceding paragraph. Notice the jerky effect of the following
extract from a letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We are sending you a copy of our latest catalogue, which gives
illustrations and prices of all our stock.</p>

<p>The illustrations are all made from actual photographs and
are faithful in representing the shoe described.</p>

<p>Bear Brand Shoes are shipped in special fiber cases, thus lessening
freight bills and eliminating the annoyance of shortage claims
because they cannot be opened without immediate detection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Errors of any kind should be reported without delay.</p>

<p>Imperfect or damaged goods must be returned for our inspection;
otherwise no allowance will be made.</p></div>

<p>2. Do not go to the other extreme, writing paragraphs of
great length. Much depends, of course, on the matter to
be treated, but, as a rule, in a student's theme a paragraph
should be not longer than one page. If one of the divisions
of your subject is necessarily long, subdivide it, allowing
a paragraph to treat each of the subdivisions.</p>

<p>Whether it is to be long or short, a paragraph must treat
but one topic; from the first sentence to the last, it should
be the development of one idea. Moreover, this topic must
be revealed to the reader in no unmistakable way. Sometimes
the subject is so simple that the topic may easily be
gathered from the details given, but usually it is well to
have one sentence that in a brief or general way states the
topic. This is called the <i>topic sentence</i>. It may be at or
near the beginning; in this case the rest of the paragraph
defines or illustrates what it states. It may, however, be
found at almost any point in the paragraph, not infrequently
acting as a sentence of conclusion, summing up the details
that have been presented.</p>

<p>A paragraph that begins with a topic sentence sometimes
ends with a sentence of conclusion. The first sentence
states the topic, the following sentences explain or illustrate
it, and the last sentence summarizes or otherwise indicates
that the topic has been completed. This form has been
called the <i>hammock</i> paragraph, because it has a solid "post"
at each end with a mass of details "swinging" between.
It is a good form to use in writing paragraphs on given
subjects, when each paragraph is to stand alone, complete
in itself, not forming part of a longer composition. The
practice of writing such paragraphs induces clear, forceful
thinking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The problem in many large firms is how to develop office efficiency
to the highest possible degree. In this respect the monthly
examination scheme has been found a great success. The examination
consists of a list of questions about merchandise and
business procedure. The questions are given out on the last
Saturday of the month, and the answers are returned for criticism
on the following Wednesday. The employees are told that
they may consult as many authorities as they wish, but each man
must write his own paper. A poor percentage in three of these
tests usually means dismissal. Thus the inefficient are dropped,
and the ambitious who have studied are recognized. The vice-president
of one concern that uses this system says that it is a
strong reminder to his men that they must make themselves
worthy of the organization. Besides maintaining an even standard
of efficiency, the plan has resulted in developing a number of
valuable executives, whose latent powers were brought out by the
rigidness of the tests.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />2</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Every month the department head in one big eastern concern,
watch in hand, times a large force of typists individually, testing
how rapidly they can write a letter of 200 words from their shorthand
notes. Rapidity, punctuation, spelling, and neatness are
carefully recorded. This plan has had a desirable influence in
bringing stenographers up to grade in their daily work, because
a good examination mark is reduced one-half by careless daily
work, and a poor examination mark correspondingly raised by
excellent daily work. When both examination average and daily
average are excellent, the stenographer's salary is increased;
when both are below good, the stenographer is dismissed. In
this way the standard of stenographic work is kept high.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In his effort to succeed many a young business man overlooks
the detail of business courtesy. He does not realize the value that
a buyer places upon that commodity. The more experienced
man, however, knows that courtesy does more to hold a buyer
than do bargain sales. In our large cities merchants have incurred
great expense to fit up rest rooms where customers may
spend an idle hour, write letters on stationery that is provided,
and read the latest magazines. In the rural districts, where such
luxuries are often impossible, the merchant provides chairs for
his customers and a place for stationing their teams. The country
merchant, however, can often accomplish his object more
quickly than the city dealer by spending an hour gossiping with
his customers. He recognizes the fact that buyers are flattered
when the proprietor himself takes the time to say a few words
to them. He knows just as well as his city competitor does,
that if a buyer feels at home in his store, sales are practically
guaranteed.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The rural landscape of Norway, on the long easterly slope that
leads up to the watershed among the mountains on the western
coast, is not unlike that of Vermont or New Hampshire. The railway
from Christiania to the Randsfjord carried us through a hilly
country of scattered farms and villages. Wood played a prominent
part in the scenery. There were dark stretches of forest on
the hilltops and in the valleys; rivers filled with floating logs;
sawmills beside the waterfalls; wooden farmhouses painted white;
and rail-fences around the fields. The people seemed sturdy,
prosperous, independent. They had the familiar habit of coming
down to the station to see the train arrive and depart. We might
have fancied ourselves on a journey through the Connecticut
valley if it had not been for the soft sing-song of the Norwegian
speech and the uniform politeness of the railway officials.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The plan of the <i>Spectator</i> must be allowed to be both original
and eminently happy. Every valuable essay in the series may be
read with pleasure separately; yet the five or six hundred essays
form a whole, and a whole which has the interest of a novel. It
must be remembered, too, that at that time no novel, giving a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
lively and powerful picture of the common life and manners of
England, had appeared. Richardson was working as a compositor.
Fielding was robbing birds' nests. Smollett was not yet
born. The narrative, therefore, which connects together the
Spectator's essays gave to our ancestors their first taste of an
exquisite and untried pleasure. That narrative was, indeed, constructed
with no art or labor. The events were such events as
occur every day. Sir Roger comes up to town to see Eugenio, as
the worthy baronet always calls Prince Eugene, goes with the
Spectator on the water to Spring Gardens, walks among the
tombs in the Abbey, and is frightened by the Mohawks, but
conquers his apprehension so far as to go to the theater when the
"Distressed Mother" is acted. The Spectator pays a visit in
the summer to Coverley Hall, is charmed with the old house, the
old butler, and the old chaplain, eats a jack caught by Will Wimble,
rides to the assizes, and hears a point of law discussed by Tom
Touchy. At last a letter from the honest butler brings to the
club the news that Sir Roger is dead. Will Honeycomb marries
and reforms at sixty. The club breaks up, and the Spectator
resigns his functions. Such events can hardly be said to form a
plot; yet they are related with such truth, such grace, such wit,
such humor, such pathos, such knowledge of the human heart,
such knowledge of the ways of the world that they charm us on
the hundredth perusal. We have not the least doubt that if
Addison had written a novel on an extensive plan, it would have
been superior to any that we possess. As it is, he is entitled to be
considered not only as the greatest of the English essayists, but
as the forerunner of the great English novelists.</p>

<div class='center'>1</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have often noticed that every one has his own individual
small economies, careful habits of saving fractions of pennies in
some one peculiar direction, any disturbance of which annoys him
more than spending shillings or pounds on some real extravagance.
An old gentleman of my acquaintance, who took the intelligence
of the failure of a Joint Stock Bank, in which some of his money
was invested, with a stoical mildness, worried his family all
through a long summer's day because one of them had torn (instead
of cutting) out the written leaves of his now useless bankbook.
Of course, the corresponding pages at the other end came
out as well, and this little unnecessary waste of paper (his private
economy) chafed him more than all the loss of his money.
Envelopes fretted his soul terribly when they came in. The
only way in which he could reconcile himself to such a waste
of his cherished article was by patiently turning inside out all
that were sent to him, and so making them serve again. Even
now, though tamed by age, I see him casting wistful glances at
his daughters when they send a whole inside of a half-sheet of
note paper, with the three lines of acceptance to an invitation
written on only one of the sides. I am not above owning that
I have this human weakness myself. String is my foible. My
pockets get full of little hanks of it, picked up and twisted together,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
ready for uses that never come. I am seriously annoyed
if any one cuts a string of a parcel instead of patiently and faithfully
undoing it fold by fold. How people can bring themselves
to use India-rubber bands, which are a sort of deification of string,
as lightly as they do I cannot imagine. To me an India-rubber
band is a precious treasure. I have one which is not new&mdash;one
that I picked up off the floor nearly five years ago. I have really
tried to use it, but my heart failed me, and I could not commit
the extravagance. Small pieces of butter grieve others. They
cannot attend to conversation because of the annoyance occasioned
by the habit which some people have of invariably taking
more butter than they want. Have you ever seen the anxious
look (almost mesmeric) which such persons fix on the article?
They would feel it a relief if they might bury it out of their sight
by popping it into their own mouths and swallowing it down;
and they are really made happy if the person on whose plate it
lies unused suddenly breaks off a piece of toast (which he does not
want at all) and eats up his butter. They think that this is not
waste. Now, Miss Matty Jenkins was chary of candles: We
had many devices to use as few as possible. In the winter afternoons
she would sit knitting for two or three hours&mdash;she could do
this in the dark or by firelight&mdash;and when I asked if I might not
ring for candles to finish stitching my wristbands, she told me to
"keep blind man's holiday." They were usually brought in with
tea, but we burnt only one at a time. As we lived in constant
preparation for a friend who might come in any evening (but who
never did), it required some contrivance to keep our two candles
of the same length, ready to be lighted, and to look as if we burnt
two always. The candles took it in turns; and then, whatever
we might be talking of or doing, Miss Matty kept her eyes habitually
fixed upon the candle, ready to jump up and extinguish it
and light the other before they had become too uneven in length
to be restored to equality in the course of the evening.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 213&mdash;Smooth Connection</b></div>

<p>We may as well confess at the beginning that smooth connection
between sentences and paragraphs is a hard thing
to learn. Primarily, it depends on clear thinking. In Exercise
135 we saw that the idea of one sentence must grow
out of the idea of the preceding one. It is the same
with paragraphs. The thought must develop gradually
from one to the next. Each paragraph, we know, represents
a unit within the larger unit of the composition; each
represents a division of thought. Not infrequently the
thought of one division differs considerably from the thought
of the next. The tying together of such units is sometimes
hard. It may be done in one of the following ways:</p>

<p>1. By repeating at the beginning of the new paragraph
or sentence part of the preceding paragraph or sentence.</p>

<p>2. By using pronouns to refer to what has gone before.</p>

<p>3. By using connecting links, sometimes called <i>transition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
words</i> because they indicate the transition from one
division to the next. Besides those mentioned in <a href="#Exercise_135">Exercise
135</a>, we may use a numeral connection, as, <i>in the first place</i>,
<i>in the second place;</i> or an expression much like a numeral,
as, <i>furthermore</i>, <i>in the next place;</i> or an expression
showing that an adverse idea is to be presented, as, <i>on the
other hand</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>in spite of this</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>. But whatever
you do, choose the right link, especially if you use such
a one as <i>possibly</i>, <i>probably</i>, <i>perhaps</i>, <i>certainly</i>, <i>surely</i>. Use
the one that expresses your idea exactly. Have none rather
than the wrong one.</p>

<p>In the following the first and second paragraphs are connected
according to (1) above; the second and third are
connected according to (3) above.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There comes to every prosperous man a time when he wishes
to know the best way of securing a steady income from his accumulated
savings without the burden of responsibility of managing
some property in order to gain his income. The merchant may
not wish to put back into the business all the earnings he gets
from it, and yet he wishes to prepare for his old age. The farmer
may wish to give up active work, but he realizes how soon his
broad acres may deteriorate through soil-robbery when he rents
his property "on shares." With such a problem before him the
thoughtful man makes an effort to <i>learn</i> how to act to secure a
good <i>income</i> all his life.</p>

<p>One of the first things he <i>learns</i>, if he studies the situation carefully,
is that there is a wide difference between an <i>income</i> derived
from one's business ability, such as the profit secured from running
a store, factory, jobbing house, or farm, and the income which
is derived as the result of money "working" by itself. In the
first case, a man must of necessity keep up his business responsibilities;
in the other, once he has selected a safe investment,
practically all he has to do is to collect his income from time to
time as it falls due. There is in the latter no depreciation of
land, buildings, machinery, or the like; no insurance payments
to worry about; no crop failures to consider.</p>

<p><i>It is evident, then</i>, that if one wishes to put surplus money away&mdash;say
the proceeds from the sale of a business or a farm&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
get a steady income from it without bother or worry, the most
important thing to consider is how to go about it to select something
which, once purchased, will turn out to be a safe investment.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 214</b></div>

<p>In the following paragraphs taken from Robert Louis
Stevenson's <i>The Philosophy of Nomenclature</i>, point out all
the transition words that join (1) sentence to sentence, and
(2) paragraph to paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To begin, then: the influence of our name makes itself felt
from the very cradle. As a schoolboy I remember the pride with
which I hailed Robin Hood, Robert Bruce, and Robert le Diable
as my name-fellows; and the feeling of sore disappointment that
fell on my heart when I found a freebooter or a general who did
not share with me a single one of my numerous <i>praenomina</i>.
Look at the delight with which two children find they have the
same name. They are friends from that moment forth; they
have a bond of union stronger than exchange of nuts and sweetmeats.
This feeling, I own, wears off in later life. Our names
lose their freshness and interest, become trite and indifferent.
But this, dear reader, is merely one of the sad effects of those
"shades of the prison house" which come gradually betwixt us
and nature with advancing years; it affords no weapon against
the philosophy of names.</p>

<p>In after life, although we fail to trace its working, that name
which careless godfathers lightly applied to your unconscious
infancy will have been moulding your character and influencing
with irresistible power the whole course of your earthly fortunes.
But the last name is no whit less important as a condition of success.
Family names, we must recollect, are but inherited nicknames;
and if the <i>sobriquet</i> were applicable to the ancestor, it is
most likely applicable to the descendant also. You would not
expect to find Mr. M'Phun acting as a mute or Mr. M'Lumpha
excelling as a professor of dancing. Therefore, in what follows,
we shall consider names, independent of whether they are first
or last. And to begin with, look what a pull <i>Cromwell</i> had over
<i>Pym</i>&mdash;the one name full of a resonant imperialism, the other
mean, pettifogging, and unheroic to a degree. Who would expect
eloquence from <i>Pym</i>&mdash;who would read poems by <i>Pym</i>&mdash;who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
would bow to the opinions of <i>Pym?</i> He might have been a dentist,
but he should never have aspired to be a statesman. I can
only wonder that he succeeded as he did. Pym and Habakkuk
stand first upon the roll of men who have triumphed, by sheer
force of genius, over the most unfavorable appellations. But
even these have suffered; and, had they been more fitly named,
the one might have been Lord Protector and the other have
shared the laurels with Isaiah. In this matter we must not forget
that all our great poets have borne great names. Chaucer,
Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, Shelley&mdash;what
a constellation of lordly words! Not a single commonplace
name among them&mdash;not a Brown, not a Jones, not a Robinson;
they are all names that one would stop and look at on a door-plate.
Now, imagine if <i>Pepys</i> had tried to clamber somehow into
the enclosure of poetry, what a blot would that name have made
upon the list! The thing is impossible. In the first place, a
certain natural consciousness that men have would have held
him down to the level of his name, would have prevented him
from rising above the Pepsine standard, and so haply withheld
him altogether from attempting verse. Next, the booksellers
would refuse to publish, and the world to read them, on the mere
evidence of the fatal appellation. And now, before I close this
section, I must say one word as to <i>punnable</i> names, names that
stand alone, that have a significance and life apart from him that
bears them. These are the bitterest of all. One friend of mine
goes bowed and humbled through life under the weight of this
misfortune; for it is an awful thing when a man's name is a joke,
when he cannot be mentioned without exciting merriment, and
when even the intimation of his death bids fair to carry laughter
into many a home.</p>

<p>So much for people who are badly named. Now for people
who are <i>too</i> well named, who go topheavy from the font, who are
baptized into a false position, and who find themselves beginning
life eclipsed under the fame of some of the great ones of the past.
A man, for instance, called William Shakespeare could never dare
to write plays. He is thrown into too humbling an apposition
with the author of <i>Hamlet</i>. His own name coming after is such
an anti-climax. "The plays of William Shakespeare?" says the
reader&mdash;"O no! The plays of William Shakespeare Cockerill,"
and he throws the book aside. In wise pursuance of such views,
Mr. John Milton Hengler, who not long since delighted us in this
favored town, has never attempted to write an epic, but has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
chosen a new path and has excelled upon the tight-rope. A
marked example of triumph over this is the case of Mr. Dante
Gabriel Rosetti. On the face of the matter, I should have advised
him to imitate the pleasing modesty of the last-named gentleman,
and confine his ambition to the sawdust. But Mr. Rosetti has
triumphed. He has even dared to translate from his mighty
name-father; and the voice of fame supports him in his boldness.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BUSINESS LETTERS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> long ago the head of one of the biggest mail order
firms in this country said: "Business needs the boys and the
girls. Do not let them think they can be but cogs in the
great system of wheels. More to-day than at any previous
time the world needs men and women who can speak and
write <i>themselves</i> into English. Four hundred million dollars
is wasted every year in unprofitable advertising alone, and
as much more in bad handling of good prospects and loss of
customers through inefficient letters. We look to the future
generation to conserve a part of this enormous loss. If a
single page advertisement in a single issue costs $7500,
what you say on that page is important. Look into any
current magazine, and you will be tremendously impressed
with the importance of English in this branch alone, not
to mention its importance in letter writing."</p>

<p>There is no greater power in business to-day than the
ability to use convincing English in correspondence and in
advertising. Any one who can write good letters, letters
that the reader feels he must answer, has success ahead of
him, because the market of a good letter is practically unrestricted.
Wherever a letter can penetrate, it may create
desire for an article and make sales.</p>

<p>But what is a good letter? Nothing more than a bit
of good English. Can you write clear, direct, crisp, yet
fluent English? Then you can write good letters&mdash;but
not till then.</p>

<p>In modern business the letter has become the advertiser,
the salesman, the collector, and the adjuster of claims. An
advertisement must be attractive; it must arouse the interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of the one who sees it. A salesman must understand human
nature; he must forestall objections by showing the customer
how he will gain by buying. The collector and the
adjuster of claims must be courteous and at the same time
shrewd. If a letter is to meet all of these requirements
it cannot be dashed off at a moment's notice. It must be
thought out in detail and written carefully to include all
that should be expressed. This means, especially in a sales
letter:</p>

<p>1. An unusually worded opening that puts the writer's
affairs in the background and the reader's gain in the foreground.
Begin with <i>you</i>, not <i>we</i>. The reader is interested
in himself, his own progress, his own troubles, and not in
the possessions of the writer, except as the writer can show
that those possessions affect him.</p>

<p>3. A clear, simply worded explanation of the purpose of
the letter.</p>

<p>3. Proof of advantages to the reader.</p>

<p>4. Persuasion or inducement to act now.</p>

<p>5. Conclusion, making this action easy.</p>

<p>Above all, if a letter is to be good, it must not be too
short. In the pursuit of brevity too many pupils in business
English make the mistake of writing altogether too little to
get the reader's attention; and if his attention is not
aroused, the letter fails. The letter should be long enough
to suggest interest in the welfare of the reader and enthusiasm
for the subject under discussion.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm in business involves knowledge both of your
project and of your customer. You cannot attempt to
write a letter of any kind unless you know the facts that
require it. Perhaps it is a complaint that you must try
to settle. Without a knowledge of the facts, of the truth or
the untruth of the claim, how can you write the letter?
Sometimes it requires both time and study to gather the
necessary details, but they must be gathered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>When you have your details and begin writing, be sincere.
You must be so absolutely in earnest that the reader will
at once feel and begin to share your enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Knowledge of the person to whom you are writing is fully
as important as knowledge of your subject. You must get
his point of view, understand his character, and appeal to
the qualities that you recognize in it, to the desires or ambitions,
that it shows. To a certain extent all of us are
alike. There are certain fundamental interests that we all
possess; these may safely be appealed to at almost all times.
But our employment, our habits of life, our ways of thinking
make us different. The same argument, probably, will
not always bring satisfactory replies from a manufacturer,
a farmer, a judge, a minister or priest, a carpenter, and a
woman. Some people like to receive a long letter that goes
carefully into detail; others will not take the time to read
such a letter. Each customer must be studied. This is so
difficult a matter that no one can expect to learn it all at
once.</p>

<p>Finally, from the first word to the last be courteous. No
matter how righteous your indignation, be courteous. You
cannot afford to lose your temper. Courtesy does not imply
flattery nor a lack of truth. Your letter can be strong and
yet polite in tone. Lose your temper, and your letter will
probably fail. Keep your temper, show thoughtfulness for
the reader's interest, and your letter will more likely fulfill
its purpose.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 216&mdash;The Form of the Letter</b></div>

<p>Before we look at some actual letters to judge of their
effectiveness, we must learn the conventional form of a
letter, the parts which many years of use have shown to
be necessary. There are six parts to a formal or business
letter:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. The heading, which includes the writer's address and the
date.</p>

<p>2. The introduction, which includes the name and the address
of the one to whom you are writing.</p>

<p>3. The salutation; for example, Dear Sir:</p>

<p>4. The body of the letter, the important part.</p>

<p>5. The courteous close; for example, Yours truly,</p>

<p>6. The signature.</p></div>

<p>Each part ends with a period except the salutation, which
ends with a colon, and the courteous close, which ends with
a comma. The various groups of words within the heading
and the introduction are separated by commas.</p>

<p>Why does the salutation end with a colon?</p>

<p>Why does the courteous close end with a comma?</p>


<div class='center'><b>The Arrangement</b></div>

<p>In the following, notice the spacing. If the heading is
short, it is put on one line; as,</p>




<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Letter heading">
<tr><td align='left'><i>Heading</i></td><td align='right'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hilliard, Fla., June 30, 1914.</td></tr>

<p>If the heading is long, arrange it in one of the following
ways:</p>

</div></div>

<p>The superscription on the envelope is arranged and punctuated
like the introduction in the letter, except that the
punctuation may be omitted from the end of lines.</p>

<p>There is a growing tendency to "block" the different
parts of a letter; that is, to begin each item of each part
directly below the first, with no indentation.</p>

<p>There is also a tendency to use no abbreviations (except
for titles like <i>Mr.</i>), the name of the month and of the state
and the word <i>street</i>, <i>avenue</i>, or <i>building</i> being spelled out.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The punctuation as shown in the examples given above is
that in more prevalent use. Certain writers, however, advocate the
omission from the formal parts of the letter of commas at the end of
lines and of periods (except to show abbreviations).</p></div>

</div>

<p>Notice that in the last example, the city and the state
are put on the same line as the street in order to make the
three lines of about the same length. Four lines might have
been used.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><i>The Salutation</i></div>

<p>If you address one man, the salutation is <i>Dear Sir;</i> as,</p>

<div class='unindent'>
Mr. John Pierce,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seattle, Wash.</span><br />

Dear Sir:<br />
</div>

<p>If you address a firm, the salutation is <i>Gentlemen;</i> as,</p>

<div class='unindent'>
Messrs. Brownleigh &amp; King,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Portland, Oregon.</span><br />

Gentlemen:<br />
</div>

<p>If you address a woman, married or single, the salutation
in business letters is <i>Dear Madam;</i> as,</p>

<div class='center'>1</div>

<div class='unindent'><br />
Mrs. John Pierce,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seattle, Wash.</span><br />

Dear Madam:<br />
</div>

<div class='center'><br />2</div>

<div class='unindent'><br />
Miss Florence Pierce,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seattle, Wash.</span><br />

Dear Madam:<br />
</div>

<p>A more familiar form of salutation is either of the
following:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>1</div>

<div class='unindent'>
Miss Florence Pierce,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seattle, Wash.</span><br />
My dear Miss Pierce:<br />
</div>

<div class='center'><br />2</div>

<div class='unindent'><br />
Miss Florence Pierce,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seattle, Wash.</span><br />
Dear Miss Pierce:<br />
</div>

<p>In using <i>Hon.</i>, the salutation is usually <i>Sir</i>.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><i>The Courteous Close</i></div>

<p>The courteous close corresponds in tone to the salutation.
If the salutation is <i>Dear Sir</i>, <i>Gentlemen</i>, or <i>Dear Madam</i>, the
courteous close should be one of the following:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Letter closings">
<tr><td align='left'>Yours truly,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Yours very truly,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Very truly yours,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Respectfully yours,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Yours respectfully,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Sincerely yours,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Very sincerely yours,</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>If the salutation is <i>Sir</i>, the courteous close should be
<i>Respectfully yours</i> or <i>Yours respectfully</i>.</p>

<p>If the body of the letter and the courteous close do not
agree in tone, the effect is often ridiculous. Suppose, for
instance, that the courteous close of (2) under <a href="#Exercise_220">Exercise 220</a>
were <i>Yours respectfully</i>. What would be the effect?</p>

<div class='center'><br /><i>The Signature</i></div>

<p>If an unmarried woman is signing a business letter, she
should avoid confusion by prefixing (Miss) to her name.</p>

<p>A married woman should sign her own name, as, <i>Alice
Pierce;</i> she should indicate her title, as <i>Mrs. John F. Pierce</i>,
either below the other or at one side.</p>

<p>No other title should be prefixed to a signature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>If a letter is signed by the name of a firm, the signature
of the one who dictated the letter is usually added; as,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Yours very truly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Smith Lumber Co.</span><br />
by &mdash;&mdash;<br />
</div>

<p>This sort of signature gives a letter the "personal touch."
Explain.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Folding a Letter</b></div>

<p>Business letter paper is about eight by ten inches. In
folding a letter sheet, (1) turn the lower edge up to about
one-eighth of an inch from the top; press the fold firmly,
keeping the edges even; (2) turn the paper so that the
folded edge is at your <i>left</i> hand; (3) fold <i>from</i> you a little
less than one-third the width of the sheet; (4) fold the
upper edge <i>down</i> toward you so that it projects a trifle
beyond the folded edge. Without turning it over, pick it
up and insert it in the envelope, putting in <i>first</i> the edge
that was folded last.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 219&mdash;Ordering Goods</b></div>

<p>If an order includes a number of separate items, it is
usually written on a separate sheet of paper. Firms often
supply blanks for this purpose. If the order is short, it
forms part of the letter. In any case, each item is placed
on a separate line, so that the items may be checked as
the order is filled. In the following, notice the arrangement
and the punctuation:</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b><a name="Exercise_220" id="Exercise_220"></a>Exercise 220&mdash;The Tone of the Letter</b></div>

<p>Undue familiarity or an evidence of loss of temper will at
once frustrate the object of a letter. A dignified letter never
shows either. Just what constitutes a dignified letter is hard
to define but fairly easy to feel. This much is certain: it must
be simple in structure, direct in its wording, and so sincere in
feeling that no one will doubt its truth. Any extravagance
of language, therefore, has no place in a dignified letter.</p>

<p>Study the following to see whether they show dignity:</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 222&mdash;Mistaken Ideas in Letter Writing</b></div>

<p>It is too bad that, to a number of people, the term <i>business
letter</i> conveys the idea of a colorless, stilted composition full
of trite and almost meaningless business formulas. No one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
reads such a letter unless he has to, and surely that is not
the kind one should practice writing. Below are given a few
of the expressions that should be avoided.</p>

<p>I. Sometimes a writer tries to impress a reader with the
volume of business he is doing by showing haste in his correspondence;
as, in</p>

<p>1. Omitting the subject; as,</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
<i>Wrong:</i> In reply to your question will say &mdash;&mdash;<br />
<i>Right:</i> In reply to your question I will say &mdash;&mdash;<br />
</div>

<p>2. Omitting articles and prepositions; as,</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
<i>Wrong:</i> Direct package care Western Canning Co.<br />
<i>Right:</i> Direct the package in care of the Western Canning Co.<br />
</div>

<p>3. Using abbreviations</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>a.</i> Of the introduction. Write out the introduction
in detail, both name and address. Abbreviating
this part of the letter is highly discourteous.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> In the body of the letter; as,</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
<i>Wrong:</i> The Co. sent a no. of large orders last year.<br />
</div>

<p><i>c.</i> Of the courteous close; as,</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
<i>Wrong:</i> Yours etc.<br />
<i>Wrong:</i> Yours resp'y.<br />
</div></div>

<p>4. Using a phrase as a sentence; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot2"><i>Wrong:</i> Yours of the 6th at hand and contents noted.</div>

<p>It is much better to refer indirectly to the receipt of a
letter; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the order you sent us on Aug. 5 &mdash;&mdash;</p></div>

<p>The same sort of mistake is seen in the all too frequent
closing:</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
<i>Wrong:</i> Hoping that we hear from you soon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 21.5em;">Yours truly,</span><br />
<i>Right:</i> Hoping that we hear from you soon, we are<br />
<span style="margin-left: 21.5em;">Yours truly,</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Why use such an expression at all? Avoid <i>hoping</i>, <i>trusting</i>,
<i>awaiting</i>, or any other artificial closing.</p>

<p>II. Sometimes a writer makes an effort to be extremely
courteous, but fails because he uses hackneyed wording; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. <i>Kindly.</i>&mdash;A good word in itself but greatly abused.</p>

<p>2. <i>We beg to state.</i>&mdash;Never use <i>beg</i> in this sense. You
have no right to beg attention; earn it.</p>

<p>3. <i>Your favor</i>, <i>your esteemed favor</i>, <i>your valued favor</i>.&mdash;Say,
<i>Your letter</i>.</p>

<p>4. <i>Will you be so good as to.</i>&mdash;Belongs in the class with
<i>beg to state</i>. Make your requests courteously, but directly.</p>

<p>5. <i>Would say.</i>&mdash;Avoid this expression.</p></div>

<p>III. Sometimes in an effort to be clear a writer uses <i>same</i>
as a pronoun; as,</p>

<div class="blockquot2"><i>Wrong:</i> If the books are not satisfactory, return same.</div>


<p>This is one of the worst of the distinctly business blunders.
<i>Same</i> is never a pronoun. Write to a man as you talk to
him and you will not use <i>same</i> in this way. (See <a href="#Exercise_88">Exercise 88</a>.)</p>

<p>IV. Sometimes in order to get attention a writer will use a
liberal sprinkling of dashes and capitals, probably in imitation
of advertising copy. Better than such artificial means
is the attraction of a well worded letter.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b><a name="Exercise_223" id="Exercise_223"></a>Exercise 223&mdash;The Sales Letter</b></div>

<p>The object of the sales letter is to make the reader buy.
How can you do it? To begin with, get his point of view&mdash;that
of the user. Then imagine that he is present and talk
to him on paper. Get his interest with your opening sentence.
Explain what you have to sell. Show him that he
needs it. Whet his desire to possess it, and, finally, make
it easy and imperative for him to order today.</p>

<p>The opening paragraph is all-important. It may make or
mar a letter. If it is stilted or lacks directness, if it hasn't
the personal, natural tone that makes the reader feel you
are talking to him, or if it is stereotyped in its wording, the
letter will probably go to the waste-basket.</p>

<p>Contrast the two letters that follow. Both were written
to accompany a catalogue. Notice that the first begins
and ends in a stereotyped way; has too few details to arouse
interest; asks for an order but has no inducement to give
one now; and, throughout, lacks the personal, convincing
tone that makes the second a good selling letter. Notice
that the second begins with <i>you</i>, not with <i>we</i>, and keeps the
same <i>you</i> attitude to the end.</p>

<p>Turn back to the five essentials of a letter given on page
230. See if you can differentiate the five in the second letter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter given above is personal and yet dignified.
Usually that is the best style to use, and the one that we
wish to practice writing. Sometimes, however, results can
best be obtained by using the colloquial or even jocular tone
illustrated in the following letter sent to a retailer in
Ottumwa, Iowa:</p>

<div class="blockquot">Dear Sir:

<p>We sell cheese, a new brand, the finest kind you ever tasted,
put up in the most attractive package, to sell at the most attractive
price. Called Par Excellence Creme, wrapped in silver foil
with a gold label, it sells for fifteen cents and costs you ten. Ever
hear a better proposition?</p>

<p>Better buy now before your rival gets ahead of you. Everybody's
calling for it. Why? Because we're advertising everywhere.
It has been out only one month, and yet sales have trebled
our highest expectations. Half the sales of a new cheese depend
on the package and the price; the other half depend on the quality.
All three are right in Par Excellence Creme.</p>

<p>Mr. S. R. King, our Iowa representative, tried to see you last
week, but, unfortunately, he was unable to find you in. Now,
he carries a full line of our samples, and it's worth the time it
takes just to see how good they look, even if you don't care to
buy. How about it? Don't you want to see them? Mr. King
will be in Ottumwa next Wednesday.</p>

<div class='sig'>

<p>This style is commonly called "snappy." It has its advantage,
but should be used only rarely. Above all, if you do use
it, avoid the dash. Notice how the dash spoils the following:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">Dear Sir:

<p>Have you ever eaten that king of nuts&mdash;the budded or grafted
paper shell pecan&mdash;the nut whose kernel is as nutritious as beef
and as sweet and delicious as honey&mdash;the nut that is so delightfully
palatable and so wholesome, the discriminating epicures of
two continents have set their seal of approval on it&mdash;creating a
demand that literally cannot be supplied&mdash;even at prices ranging
as high as a dollar a pound.</p></div>

<p>To use the dash in this way seems to imply that you do
not understand punctuation or sentence structure. If the
paragraph is rewritten, removing the dashes and dividing
into sentences, we get a much stronger appeal. The dash
makes for weakness rather than for strength because it
suggests hysterics.</p>

<p>A very good way to open a sales letter is to get the attention
by a bit of narration containing direct quotations, as
shown in the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">Dear Sir:

<p>"It saves seven per cent."</p>

<p>So said Mr. John H. Samuels, a manufacturer of Birmingham,
Ala.</p>

<p>He had watched his bookkeepers at their work, and it seemed
to him that their main business was turning and flattening the
springy pages of the bulgy ledger. Ten seconds were wasted, he
said, every time a page was turned&mdash;almost every time an entry
was made&mdash;and hardly more than two minutes were needed to
make the entry. That was enough. Each of his twenty men
was wasting seven per cent of his time.</p>

<p>"Try hinged paper," suggested the head bookkeeper.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Mr. Samuels tried several kinds of hinged paper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
only to find that the hinged section tore, broke, or cracked. The
time that the clerks now saved in flattening the leaves they wasted
in rewriting the pages that had torn out.</p>

<p>He had no more faith in hinged papers by the time that he saw
the advertisement of the Benton hinge. "As strong as the rest of
the paper!" he scoffed. "We'll see about this!"</p>

<p>"Send me a sample," he wrote us. "If your ad tells the truth,
you get my order."</p>

<p>We sent it. He tested it. He pulled it, crumpled it, ruled on
it, erased it on both sides, and even creased it. But it did not
break.</p>

<p>Very cautiously and doubtingly he tried the paper in one
ledger for one month. He found that the book rolled flat whenever
it was opened, that no hinge tore, and that every page could
be used from binder to outer edge.</p>

<p>"It does the work," he told our salesman at the end of the
month. "It saves seven per cent. Send me a consignment."</p>

<p>If you, too, are paying seven per cent of your bookkeepers'
salaries for waste motion, let us send you a sample. It will cut
down your expenses as it cut down Mr. Samuels'.</p>

<p>Remember that you put yourself under no obligation to us.
You take no risks. Simply promise to use the paper if we send
it free.</p>

<div class="blockquot">Dear Sir:

<p>People who have not had much of what the world calls "good
luck" find it hard to believe an opportunity when it comes&mdash;they
don't feel sure about it&mdash;on the other hand, people who
have had many opportunities have a natural confidence that
every opening presented is intended for them and they grasp it
with an assurance that begets success.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 225&mdash;Opening an Account</b></div>

<p>Imagine that you are manager of a wholesale dry goods
house. You have received an order from P. H. Powley, 23
Water street, Franklin, Mich. As you do not know Mr.
Powley, write him, stating in as courteous a way as possible
that, since this is his first order, he must either furnish references
or send a remittance. Make your letter direct and
personal. Include some good selling talk.</p>

<p>The exercise above illustrates the method that might be
adopted in case of a small order. If Mr. Powley had sent
a large order, the wholesale house would no doubt consult
a financial agency to discover his financial condition;
his <i>rating</i>, it is called. If his name were not found in the
book of the agency, the wholesale house would require Mr.
Powley to send a correct account of his financial standing;
that is, a list of his assets and liabilities. If he refused, they
would not do business with him. Why? The principal
financial agencies are Bradstreet and Dun. Besides these,
there are many mercantile agencies. They give any information
that is required concerning a business man. All
such information is confidential.</p>

<p>In connection with this exercise study the letters that

<div class="blockquot">Dear Sir:

<p>In seeking information through the usual outside channels for
basing credit for you, we find our reports have not been sufficient
in detail to permit us to arrange this matter satisfactorily. These
reports all speak very highly of you in a personal way, but do not
give us the required information financially.</p>

<p>We assume you want our goods for your Christmas trade. It
is imperative, therefore, that we ship immediately. We suggest
that on this order you send us a draft, in consideration of which
we shall be pleased to allow you a special discount of 4%. Understand
that we suggest these terms on this first order only, as we
feel confident that we can easily arrange a credit basis for future
shipments. We sincerely trust you will take no offense at the
above suggestion, as we have made it in your interest.</p>

<div class="blockquot">Dear Sir:

<p>Thank you for the order you sent us yesterday. Its size confirms
the belief we have always held that D&mdash;&mdash; is a rapidly
growing business center, the right place for a retailer to settle
and prosper.</p>

<p>After careful consideration of your letter, however, we have
decided to hold back your order for a short time. You cannot
regret this more than we do. We do not like to lose your account,
and yet, under the circumstances, we feel we cannot send you the
order. We hope you can sell the property you mentioned in your
letter and thus clear up the balances against you. Then we
shall gladly open an account for you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>We are especially sorry we cannot send the order at once, as
you no doubt need your fall stock now. Don't you think it would
be the best solution if you would send us your remittance for $250
now, so that we may send the goods? We know what it means
to buy in the open market so late in the season. We assure you
that on receipt of a remittance the order will go through immediately.</p>

credit. They say they do a very large business as they have
the only drug store within a radius of several miles. They give
several names as references. Write the letter.</p>

<p>2. You are a traveling salesman for Pierce, King &amp; Co. They

letter, a copy of which they enclose, and asking you to investigate
the standing of Messrs. Lee and Watkins.</p>

<p>Reply that you visited the drug store in question on a Tuesday

week is very quiet in the business of small towns. Say that two
clerks were kept busy constantly and that several people spoke
of the enormous business done on Saturdays and market days.
The firm has good credit in the town. You are satisfied that the
gentlemen in question are reliable.</p>

<p>3. Write from Pierce, King &amp; Co. to Messrs. Lee and Watkins,
acknowledging the receipt of their letter &mdash;&mdash; (date) and expressing
pleasure in being able to enter their name on the firm's

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 230&mdash;Letters Requesting Payment</b></div>

<p>It is better not to make threats in a collection letter except
as a last resort, and then the threat should be carried out. It
is advisable in a first letter of the kind to take for granted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
that a customer is honest and that the failure to pay is
an oversight. If some inducement for further purchases is
included in the letter in the form of good selling talk, a
remittance will probably be sent, and perhaps another order
as well.</p>

<p>If the customer, however, takes no notice of the first letter,
a second, making the request for payment more urgent,
may follow. The tone of the second letter and subsequent
letters will depend on the value that you put on the customer's
trade. Finally, if he ignores all of these letters,
dally no longer. Say that if payment is not made by a
certain date, you will draw on him at sight. If he does
not honor the draft, put the matter in the hands of your
attorney.</p>

<div class='center'>1</div>

<div class="blockquot">Dear Sir:

<p>Ten days ago we mailed you a statement of your account,
which was due at that time. As we have heard nothing from
you, we have concluded that the letter must have miscarried.
We are, therefore, enclosing a duplicate of the former statement.
We trust that it will reach you safely and have your prompt
attention.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Yours very truly,<br />

<div class='center'><br />2</div>

<div class="blockquot">Dear Sir:

<p>Evidently you, too, are experiencing the increase in business
that our customers in general are reporting. In the rush of orders
you probably have overlooked the fact that your account with
us is three weeks over-due. Your remittances hitherto have been
very prompt, and we trust that this reminder will be treated
equally promptly.</p>

<p>By the way, have you found that the Holeless Socks are coming
up to our guarantee? From all parts of the country we are getting
flattering reports in the form of big orders. We feel that
they merit their popularity, and with the extensive advertising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>

<div class="blockquot">Dear Sir:

<p>In looking over our accounts, we find that your purchases have
lately been increasing considerably and that your payments have
been few and unimportant. Statements have been sent regularly,
we believe, but have probably been overlooked because of the
stress of your other affairs. Such things, of course, can happen
with any of us, especially when we have many other matters to
look after.</p>

<p>We have always valued your account, and we greatly desire
our pleasant relations to continue. As the amount that you owe
us is now long over-due, we would appreciate your returning the
enclosed bill to be receipted during the next few days.</p>

a longer extension except by special arrangement. We have
borne the matter very patiently, realizing that unusual conditions
sometimes prevent one's doing as he desires. At the same time,
it is entirely out of reason that your account should still be owing
at this time. May we not expect your remittance by return
mail?</p>

do almost anything to accommodate our customers, we feel that
in your case the time for concessions has passed. We desire your
check at once for the balance due us.</p>

<p>You are credited with using considerable money in your business,
and it would seem that you should without difficulty be able to
take care of amounts such as you owe us. If we do not hear
from you by April 1, we shall send a second draft. If you permit
this to be returned unpaid, we shall be compelled to take action
to force collection. We wish to express the hope, however, that

<p>3. Your bank notifies you that your draft has been returned
unpaid. Write Phillips, asking for an explanation. Say that

<p>4. Phillips writes an apologetic letter, giving illness as the
reason for his non-payment. He says he was in the hospital and
did not receive letters (1) and (2). He encloses fifty dollars and
promises to pay at least half the balance next month, the full
amount within sixty days. Write his letter.</p>

<p>2. One correspondent in reply demands a return of $16,
which he had paid for a coat that was "not worth a cent." How
would you reply to this letter so that the one making the complaint
would send in an order? Write the letter.</p></div>

<p>In connection with this exercise study the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">Dear Sir:

<p>We wish to acknowledge your letter of April 16, in which you
say that on April 14 you received a bill for five S &amp; Q Railway
bonds, which Mr. Wensley had sold you on the 11th at 100 and
interest; that you sent us your check for the amount on the same
day; and that on the 16th, two days afterward, you received a
letter from us, offering a new block of these bonds at 99 and
interest.</p>

<p>This complication was brought about through a peculiar chain
of circumstances, an explanation of which, we feel, is only just
both to you and to us. When Mr. Wensley came to the office on
Saturday, the 12th, he told us that he had your order for five of
these bonds at 100&frac14; and interest. The market price was then
100 and interest, and we were very glad to give you the benefit
of the more favorable price. At that time we had no intimation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
that more of these bonds were coming on the market. Quite
unexpectedly on Monday we received notice from our Boston
office that they had in view a new block of the bonds. Even at
that time we did not know definitely that we would get them.
On Tuesday, again quite unexpectedly, we were instructed by our
Boston office that the bonds had been secured and were to be
offered immediately at 99 and interest. So suddenly did the
entire transaction take place that we were unable to prepare a
new circular, and on Tuesday night we merely sent out a letter,
telling our customers that we had an additional block of these
bonds. In fact, the new circular will not be ready until about
noon of to-morrow.</p>

<p>We realize that you should have been informed of the new
price. The bonds, however, came on the market so quickly and
in taking care of the details of the offering we were so busy that
the matter, unfortunately, was overlooked. We are glad, therefore,
to make adjustment of the price now by having our banking
department send you our check for $50.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary for us to say, we presume, that we regret this
occurrence and to assure you that had we known of the new bonds
on Saturday we would have advised you to hold off your purchase
until the offering was ready. We feel that you know us and the
policy of our house well enough to be sure that we would not willfully
take advantage of you in this way. We trust that the
arrangement that we have made satisfactorily straightens out
the matter.</p>

<p>1. What is the advantage of the policy shown in the following
suggestion from <i>System?</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The manager of a retail establishment says: "We never
refuse to refund money. If a dissatisfied customer returns a
purchase, before we ask what the trouble is we refund his money
gladly. When he is free to walk out of the store with his money,
we try to find the source of the trouble. Generally we can adjust
the difficulty and make a sale."</p></div>

<p>2. State the advantage in the policy of a large clothing
concern which follows the sale of every suit or overcoat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>

writes Messrs. Fiske &amp; Jones that he refuses to accept the goods
because of the delay. He has bought elsewhere in the meantime.</p>

<p>2. Fiske &amp; Jones apologize for the delay and explain that it

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 238&mdash;Letters of Application</b></div>

<p>A letter of application usually has three parts. In writing
such a letter, first, tell where you saw the advertisement
and apply for the position; second, tell your qualifications
and give your references; third, end the letter appropriately,
possibly asking for an interview.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>This is a difficult kind of letter to write. Not only should
it be neat in appearance and clearly written, but it should
also be so carefully worded that it will show enough of the
writer's individuality to distinguish it from a form. Be
neither hesitant nor bold, but tell your qualifications in a
simple, straightforward way.</p>

<p>Study the following letters. Are they convincing? Do
they show the personality of the writers, or are they mere
forms?</p>

Gentlemen:<br />


<p>Your advertisement in to-day's Record for a salesman who
knows the tea and coffee business interests me. I should like
you to consider my application for the position.</p>

<p>Since my graduation from the Blank High School, four years
ago, I have been employed as salesman for the Economy Wholesale
Coffee Co., a firm doing business in this city and its outlying
districts. During these four years I have gathered a wide knowledge
of the principles of the buying and selling of coffees and teas
and of the grades and blends of both, just the training, it seems to
me, that you wish to secure.</p>

<p>You may depend upon my taking an active interest in your
business, because I have an intense desire to advance. I myself
vouch for my honesty and earnestness, and Mr. Robert Brown of
the firm mentioned above has assured me that he will supply you
with any information that you may wish as to my character or
ability. He endorses my desire to secure a broader opportunity.</p>

<p>If the position that you have to offer is one in which there is
a real future for an energetic, capable man, I should like to have
an interview with you.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Yours very respectfully,<br />

Dear Sir:<br />


<p>I am answering your advertisement in to-day's Record for a

business, my idea being to work into the sales department. If
the position that you advertise affords such an opportunity, I
wish to apply for it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>I have had a little experience in the retail dry goods business,
having worked as clerk for Mr. Amos Jones of this city during
the past two summers. What I have seen and learned of the
business makes me feel that I have ability as a dry goods salesman.
I shall be glad to work hard in a clerical position if only
I get a chance to learn and to advance.</p>

<p>I am eighteen years of age and have just graduated from the
Blank High School, where I took the four-year commercial course.
This, as you know, includes business arithmetic, bookkeeping,
and some business practice. During the last two years I was
business manager of the high school paper. This position gave
me considerable experience in handling details rapidly and in
soliciting advertising. It is this latter experience that makes me
feel that I would have success in selling.</p>

<p>I am confident that I can please you, and I should be grateful
if you will grant me an interview. Mr. Amos Jones, 815 E. 47th
St., will be glad to give you any information that you may wish as
to my work, and if you desire I can furnish other references.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 243&mdash;Form Letters</b></div>

<p>It frequently happens in business that you receive a
number of letters requiring practically the same answer.
In such cases, the best plan is to have one letter that is as
good a letter of its kind as you can write. Use that as an
answer to all those to which it can be made to apply.
You may have to add a bit of information or change a word
here and there, but, practically, you are using the same
form for all the letters. When you have mastered the
form, the answering of letters of this class will be a simple
matter. The letter accompanying a catalogue may easily
be a form. (See the second letter in <a href="#Exercise_223">Exercise 223</a>.)</p>

<p>The danger, however, is that the use of form letters tends
to make work mechanical. When letters are different, they
must receive different replies. A form letter should never
be used just because it is easy to use when it does not
really apply.</p>

<p>Mandel Bros., Chicago, Ill., announce their annual sale
of silk remnants. Make this a good advertisement that will
reach several classes of customers. Have in it as one item
white wash silk of heavy quality, 36 inches wide, at 47 cents
a yard.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Make out a sales letter for the above.</p>

<p>2. Several mail orders have been received in excess of the
supply. Make out a form letter that could be sent when the
money is returned. What is the advantage of a form letter in
this case?</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 244&mdash;Circular and Follow-up Letters</b></div>

<p>There is a class of letters that usually originates in the
advertising department of a firm. They are not sent out to
answer inquiries, but to solicit new customers and to keep
old ones. Such letters are printed in large numbers in
imitation of typewriting, and the introduction and the
salutation are afterward carefully filled in on the typewriter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
The intention, of course, is to make the recipient
feel that he has received a personal letter. Firms are
generally careful to fill in the signature in pen and ink.
These are called <i>circular</i> letters. (See the last letter in
<a href="#Exercise_223">Exercise 223</a>.)</p>

<p>These letters are very important and each year more
numerous. Frequently a series of them is written, each one
expanding one argument in a series of arguments. If all the
letters are read, one after the other, you have a complete
list of reasons why you should buy the particular article
which the letters advertise. These letters are sent out regularly,
so that the effect of one may not quite wear off before
the next arrives. It is frequently the case that not until
the third or fourth letter is sent out does any reply come.
Such letters should be definitely planned in order to present
arguments that are true and attractive. They must be
simply and clearly written. They are called <i>follow-up</i> letters.</p>

<p>The following series of follow-up letters was intended to be
sent to women who keep no maids. The series was planned
to contain five letters. Write two more, using different
appeals from those in the letters here given.</p>

<div class="blockquot">Dear Madam:

<p>Do you remember the fairy tale of Little Two-Eyes?</p>

<p>A fairy, out of pity for the child's hunger, spread a table before
her each day as she was watching the goat in the field, and when
her appetite was satisfied all the child had to say was, "Table clear
yourself," and the dishes magically disappeared.</p>

<p>"This is a beautiful way to keep house," was Two-Eyes' verdict,
and every woman, thinking of her own distaste of dirty
dishes, will agree.</p>

<p>"How I hate dishwashing!" You have said it hundreds of
times&mdash;after every meal, probably.</p>

<p>"I like to cook and bake," you declare. "They are really
interesting. There is fun in trying new recipes&mdash;but the dishes!"</p>

<p>You enjoy giving luncheon and dinner parties. It is a delightful
way of meeting one's friends. Moreover, you are justly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
proud of your skill in cooking, and you like to show your beautiful
china. But what a damper it is on your spirit of good-fellowship,
after the guests are gone, to have to spend an hour or more
washing the dishes. Then you would like to say, with the child
in the story, "Dishes wash yourselves!" Wouldn't you?</p>

<p>Well, you may. For thirty days&mdash;ninety meals&mdash;we will
put the Fairy Dishwasher in your home, without charging you a
penny.</p>

<p>The machine is simplicity itself. Wheel the cabinet into your
dining room, alongside your serving table, and, as a course is
finished, without rising from your place, stack the dishes into the
washer. When you have finished the meal, wheel the cabinet
into your kitchen, make the connection, and turn the switch.
In a few minutes the dishes are washed and dried. Having
friends in to dinner is fun when the Fairy washes the dishes.</p>

<p>Let the Fairy do yours. Simply return this letter to us in the
enclosed envelope, making sure that your name and address are
correct, and we'll send you the Fairy. Use it three times a day
for thirty days. Then if you think you can get along as well
without the machine, all that you need to do is to send us a postal
card, telling us so. We'll take back the Fairy and ask no questions.</p>

<p>But send to-day.</p>

<div class="blockquot">Dear Madam:

<p>Did you ever envy another woman's smooth, white hands?
You looked at hers, and then you looked at yours; you sighed
and thought, "It's dishwashing."</p>

<p>But what can you do? Haven't you tried everything to make
dishwashing less drudgery? Haven't you tried patent soaps and
tepid water, only to find that the dishes were not clean? Haven't
you tried dish mops, scrapers, and rubber gloves, only to find
that the mop and the scraper saved but one hand? As for rubber
gloves, as likely as not, the first time you used them they were
caught on the prong of a fork and were thereafter useless. Yes,
you've tried everything; haven't you?</p>

<p>No, you haven't. You have not tried the only sure help that
there is. Stop your drudgery and let the Fairy wash your dishes.</p>

<p>For thirty days&mdash;ninety trials&mdash;we will put the Fairy Dishwasher
in your home, absolutely free of charge, guaranteed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
wash and sterilize your dishes in boiling water, without a touch
of your hand.</p>

will bring the Fairy at once.</p>

<div class="blockquot">Dear Madam:

<p>An extra hour of leisure every day! What is it worth to you?</p>

<p>Think what you could do if some one would give you an extra
hour of leisure every day. There's the book you would like to
read, the call you ought to make, the embroidery you wish you
could finish. There are the thousand and one things that a housekeeper
continually wishes she could do&mdash;but where can she get
the time?</p>

<p>And yet you waste at least an hour each day washing dishes
when the Fairy Dishwasher will not only save you the time but
rid you of a distasteful task. You pay 16<span class='small'><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> cents a day for five
months and the Fairy does your dishes every day; you buy
yourself an extra hour every day,&mdash;you are an hour ahead
every day for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Is it worth the price?</p>

<p>Remember that we allow you to use the Fairy for thirty days&mdash;ninety
meals&mdash;before you pay a penny. Then for five months
you send us five dollars a month, and we guarantee that you will
declare it the best twenty-five dollars that you ever spent.</p>

<h2>PART III&mdash;BUSINESS PRACTICE</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MANUFACTURE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following chapters will furnish exercises in composition,
both oral and written, based upon the various phases
of business. They are intended to show the application of
the principles underlying manufacturing, buying, and selling.
Of course, we cannot expect to go into great detail in
any one of the divisions. That must be reserved for future
study, perhaps reserved until the time that you enter a
particular business. We must remember that our first
consideration is the study of English, the problem of clear-cut
expression. Underlying clear-cut expression is clear-cut
thinking. It cannot be repeated too often that without
a definite thought there can be no definite wording of the
thought. To say, "I know, but I don't know how to tell
it," shows a lazy brain. Learn to exercise your thinking
powers so that you can force them to stay upon a subject
until you have thought it out carefully and can express it.
All of the oral exercises in the following chapters require
careful preparation. This does not mean that they should be
written out before the recitation, but it does mean that they
must be carefully thought out. The preparation need not take
a particular form. The main thing is that you know exactly
the points that you wish to make before you begin to speak.
If the exercise calls for a paragraph, have clearly in mind the
plan by which you expect to expand your thought. Perhaps
you expect to begin with, or to lead up to, a topic sentence.
Remember that this may be done in several ways. Choose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
whichever plan seems best. If the exercise does not call
for a particular form, such as a paragraph or a debate, you
are left free to develop your thought in the way that you
think fits your subject best and to the length which you
think it demands.</p>

<p>There are many different kinds of businesses. We shall not
attempt to consider any except the most common and fundamental.
Some, like farming or mining, consist in bringing
forth certain products from the ground. Such products
are called raw materials, of which an example is wheat.
Some raw materials are sold and used unchanged, but most
of them go through the process of manufacture in order to
be directly usable. The miller is an example of a manufacturer,
because from wheat he makes flour. In this chapter
we shall study the principles underlying manufacture.</p>

<p>The exercises do not by any means exhaust the subject.
Each one is to be considered as a nucleus about which others
are to be grouped. If you live in a manufacturing district,
other subjects will easily suggest themselves. If you have
studied Industrial History or Commercial Geography, you
probably have in mind a number of topics for discussion.
If you know but little about raw materials, read some of
the books suggested in Exercise 257. At all events let your

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 250&mdash;Manufacture</b></div>

<p>Almost all the things we eat, wear, and use every day are
manufactured articles. Each one of them requires its own
particular process in the making, involving the necessity
in most cases of complex and expensive machinery, of expert
workmen, and of still more expert management. Take, for
example, the shoes we wear, in the manufacture of which
an amazing number of complicated machines and of expert<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
workmen is necessary. According to the United States
Department of Labor, men's rough shoes go through eighty-four
distinct processes performed by skilled workmen and
automatic machines. No less amazing is the amount of
work turned out by these machines. It has been estimated
that the McKay machine, which attaches the soles to the
uppers, sews up in about one hour and a half one hundred
pairs, an amount which it would take ninety-eight hours, or
about eleven whole working days, to sew by hand.</p>

<p>Each manufacturing business has peculiarities, machinery,
methods, and even a language of its own; sometimes men
must spend years in the study of the technicalities of certain
manufacturing businesses before they become expert in them.
It is evident that we cannot take up any one of them here
except in so far as the principles of one apply to all, and
these can be set down only very briefly.</p>

<p>The first essential to successful manufacturing is correct
buying. In fact, in some businesses this is so essential that
the buyer gets a larger salary than the manager himself.
We can see the reason for this when we consider that a
good buyer must understand not only the materials that
he buys, but also the manufacturing processes, so that,
knowing the process through which the raw materials will
go in his particular business, he will buy those materials
that will make the most profitable manufactured articles.</p>

<p>The next essential, and in most cases the most important
one from the manufacturing standpoint, is a management
capable of producing the best product at the least cost. The
managers decide what shall be produced and how; they hire
the workmen and decide what each shall do; they decide
what shall be done by hand and what by machinery; and
they choose the machines. Sometimes they go even so far
as to determine exactly the method in which each task shall
be done, and whenever they see that it would be advantageous
to install a machine, they do so. Pursuing this policy, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Chicago yeast concern not long ago put in three machines
for wrapping the small yeast cakes, eliminating the services
of 140 girls and cutting the cost of wrapping to three-fifths
of what it had been. In the steel business the early success
of Andrew Carnegie and the famous Bill Jones was largely
due to the fact that on several occasions they did not hesitate
to break up half a million dollars' worth of machinery and
replace it with newer and more efficient kinds.</p>

<p>The third essential to manufacturing success is aggressive
marketing of the product. From the standpoint of money
success this is probably the most important consideration;
so important is it, in fact, that it will be more fully discussed
in the chapter following.</p>

and collars.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Write an order to The American Printing Mill, 1038 Canal
St., Passaic, N. J., for several bolts each of percale, madras, corded
madras, and silk striped madras. Use catalogue numbers.</p>

<p>2. Write another order to The Trescott Silk Mill, 976 River
St., Paterson, N. J., for several bolts each of No. 62, No. 14,
and No. 20 shirting silks, No. 62 being a striped silk and
the others figured. Be definite in ordering the colors that you
wish.</p>

<p>3. You have received an order from Spencer &amp; Mitchell, 1925
Pearl St., Albany, N. Y. Write a letter, thanking them for the
order and explaining when and how the goods will be sent.</p>

<p>4. You have received an order from William F. Atwood, 590
Jackson St., Wilmington, Del., for a certain style of collar on
which there has been a run. Write a letter, explaining that it will
take about three weeks to fill the orders that you now have for
this collar and that you therefore cannot send Mr. Atwood's
goods before the end of the month.</p>

<p>5. The goods have arrived from The Trescott Silk Mill. You
find, however, that two bolts of No. 14 are badly soiled. Write
a letter, saying that you are returning the bolts and asking to have
the matter adjusted.</p>

<p>6. A. W. Trescott, President of The Trescott Silk Mill, replies,
expressing regret that the goods were soiled and saying that two
clean bolts of No. 14 are being sent at once. Write his letter.</p>

<p>7. You have on hand about 50 gross men's striped madras
collars, for which there is no longer a call. Write to Markham
Bros., wholesale jobbers, 1765 Greenwich St., New York City,
asking what price they will offer for the lot.</p>

<p>8. Accept their offer of $1.50 a gross for the collars.</p>

<p>9. A customer sends a cash order for goods at last year's prices,
10% below present prices. Write a politic reply.</p>

<p>10. Owing to the mildness of the winter, you fear that you
will not sell your stock of men's flannel shirts. Write a circular
letter, offering the shirts in lots of 25 dozen each, assorted sizes
and colors, at a 35% reduction in price. Address one letter to.
Frederick H. Howard, a dealer at 775 Cedar St., Harrisburg, Pa.</p>

Norwich, Conn. She has owed you $125 for six months. You
have been lenient with Miss MacComb because you know that
she has had difficulty in meeting her bills. However, you feel
that she should pay at least a part of her indebtedness to you.
Write a courteous letter, longer and more persuasive than if it
were to go to a man, demanding payment but retaining the customer's
good will. This is a difficult letter to write. Prepare it
carefully.</p></div>

the same letter to the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce of
Great Falls, Mont.; Memphis, Tenn.; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis,
Ind. Ask the Secretary to tell you the prospects for such
a factory in his city, and what inducements the city will offer you.
(By writing to different cities, the teacher can obtain their booklets

<p>2. Investigate the conditions in one of the cities mentioned
above and reproduce the letter that the Secretary wrote.</p>

<p>3. Of the four cities, Great Falls appeals to you as the best
location for your factory. Write again, asking the Secretary
especially about the water power facilities offered and the rates
charged for electrical power.</p>

<p>4. He replies that Great Falls has the most extensive power
in the United States, the hydro-electric power being ready for
delivery in any quantity at exceptionally low rates. He tells of
the many factories that are already located in Great Falls
because of its water power facilities.</p>

<p>5. Great Falls is your choice. After your factory is built
and your machinery installed, write to the Secretary of the Sand
Point Lumber Co., Sand Point, Idaho, asking him to submit
figures for a contract for supplying all your fir lumber. Tell
him you think you will use about a million board feet a year.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>d.</i> Relative uniformity of work turned out.</span><br />
</div>

<p>3. The number of working hours.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Some factories have made the experiment of reducing the
number of working hours from ten to eight without reducing the
wages of the workers. They have found that the quantity of
work turned out is increased and the quality improved. Can
you explain why?</p></div>

<p>4. The advantages of the profit-sharing plan, both for
employer and for employee.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is a plan by which a certain per cent of the profits of the
business is divided annually among the employees. (See a very
interesting article in <i>System</i> for March, 1911, or read <i>Profit-sharing
between Employer and Employee</i> by N. P. Gilman.)</p></div>

<p>5. Specialized labor.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There was a time when a man made all the parts of a pair of
shoes. Why in modern factories does he make only one part?
Which system tends to make shoes of uniform workmanship? Is
uniformity a good quality in manufacture? This principle applies
to any kind of factory.</p></div>

<p>6. Special products.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Suppose that you manufactured a large number of styles of
millinery, or novelty, footwear. Would you expect your profits
on these to be larger or smaller than on your staple styles? Give
reasons and illustrations.</p></div>

<p>7. Why is there a struggle between labor and capital?</p>

<p>8. What is the cause of strikes?</p>

<p>9. Are strikes a good thing for manufacture?</p>

<div class='center'>1</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is stated that practical experience with gas mantles made of
artificial silk&mdash;that is, silk made from wood pulp&mdash;has proved
them to be far superior to those made of cotton, especially where
the mantles are exposed to excessive vibration. Several German
towns are said to be obtaining exceptionally good results from
these new mantles used in conjunction with pressure gas, and it
is asserted that the mantles are in good condition after being
used for seven or eight weeks. Artificial silk, according to reports,
has also been used experimentally by several manufacturers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of incandescent gas mantles in the United Kingdom. The reports
are all very encouraging, except that there seems to be one difficulty
that is purely mechanical&mdash;the knitting of the artificial
silk. The knots and other imperfections in the yarn cause a
considerable amount of waste. However, the knitting-machine
makers are experimenting to overcome it.&mdash;<i>Daily Consular and

<div class='center'><br />2</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As the production of wool in this country, although approximating
320,000,000 pounds a year, does not begin to meet the
demands for the raw material, there is a yearly importation of
from 156,000,000 to over 300,000,000 pounds. When each new
census reveals the fact that there are fewer sheep of shearing age
in the country than there were ten years before, the question
of wool production becomes one of still greater importance. A
solution may be found in a Peruvian product. A variety of cotton
grows in Peru whose long, rough, crinkly fiber mixes so readily
with wool that manufacturers use it in connection with wool in
manufacturing "all wool" goods. It grows on a small tree that
yields two or three crops a year for seven or eight years. The
area, however, in which it is being successfully cultivated in Peru
is so limited that the annual output is only about 16,000,000
pounds, of which the United States takes approximately 5,500,000
pounds. As the region in which it thrives is practically rainless,
perhaps a way may be found to persuade the rough Peruvian to
make a home for itself in the hot and arid regions of our Southwest.
It would be a triumph of agriculture, certainly, to raise vegetable
wool in regions not fitted for real sheep.&mdash;<i>The Wall Street Journal.</i></p></div>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Casting of Metals</span></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As is well known, some metals are unsuitable for casting, while
others, like iron, can readily be cast into any desired shape. The
property of casting well, it is said, depends upon whether the metal
contracts or expands in solidifying from the liquid form. Iron,
like water, expands in solidifying, and hence the solid metal may
be seen floating in the liquid iron about it. The expansion causes
it to fill the die into which it is poured, and so it can be cast easily.
Gold and silver contract in cooling, and are, therefore, not suitable
for casting.&mdash;<i>Harper's Weekly.</i></p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>DISTRIBUTION</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Correct</span> buying and the most efficient methods of manufacture
play a large part in the successful carrying on of a
business, but the most important consideration is the successful
marketing or distributing of the product after it has been
manufactured or bought. Very few products are so superior
in quality that they sell themselves purely on merit. Competition
in business to-day is so keen that, in order to find
a market for his product, a merchant must create a demand
for it. Thus at its very foundation, distribution is merely
a process of creating a demand and then filling that demand.
For instance, the retail merchant is concerned with bringing
the customers to his store rather than to his competitor's
across the street. The wholesale merchant is concerned with
having the retailers handle his goods rather than those of
another firm. The mail order merchant is concerned with
getting the farmer's business before some other dealer gets
it. The salesman is concerned with writing the order before
a rival from another house writes it.</p>

<p>In the first place, the merchant must handle those things
that his customers consider necessary or desirable. Overcoats
cannot be sold in August, ashsifters on the equator,
nor electric fans in Iceland. Different peoples, different
times, and different conditions create different demands,
and it is the merchant's business to study those demands
and to fill them. In the second place, he must leave no stone
unturned in endeavoring to make his product more desirable
than that of his competitors. This may mean extensive
advertising campaigns, expensive displays, outlay for costly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
catalogues and booklets, the expenditure of money for
inducements to bring customers, or the hiring of expert
salesmen. In fact, thousands of plans are carried out every
year in this endeavor to increase trade.</p>

<p>The getting of new and additional business, however, is
only one of the important considerations that the merchant
must always have in mind. He must also keep what business
he already has by maintaining the standard of his goods
and by giving his customers satisfactory service. One of
the first essentials in this question of service is promptness
and exactness of delivery. In this the merchant must depend
very largely on the transportation companies, and therefore
a brief study of these facilities will be especially in
place at this point.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Transportation</b></div>

<p>Transportation is an essential item in the problem of distribution.
If you wished to drink a cup of coffee and found
that none could be had except in Brazil, you would begin to
realize how much the steamship company and the railroad
company have done in transporting and hauling it where
you might buy it. The same is true of our oranges from
California and Florida, our apples from Washington and
Oregon, and our grain from the Middle States. In fact,
in the case of many products the most important item is
not growing them, but bringing them to market, since the
transportation charges are often much greater than the actual
cost of producing. Thousands of barrels of apples rot on the
ground every year because their quality does not warrant
the high transportation charges, the lack of transportation
rendering them useless. In a smaller measure, the delivery
wagons in our cities and towns are essential to us because
they save us the trouble of carrying our purchases about.
Thus, the element of transportation enters into our lives
every day, saving us inconvenience, bringing to us necessities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
that we demand and luxuries that we like, and, at
the same time, increasing the price of commodities.</p>

<p>Common carriers, as transportation companies are called,
are of two general classes:</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
1. Those operating on water&mdash;the steamship companies.<br />
2. Those operating on land&mdash;the railroad companies.<br />
</div>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Steamship Company</span></div>

<p>Steamship companies operate three general kinds of lines:
(1) lines consisting of the largest and fastest steamers which
carry only passengers, mail, and valuable parcels; (2) lines
using slower steamers which carry both passengers and freight;
and (3) lines employing vessels&mdash;steamers, sailing vessels,
and barges&mdash;which carry only freight. The cost of hauling
cargoes by water is in every case less per mile than that of
carrying the same quantity of goods on land. It costs, for
example, over four times as much to carry a bushel of wheat
from Chicago to New York by rail as it does to carry it across
the Atlantic. It is for this very reason that the traffic on
our navigable rivers, the Ohio and the Mississippi, and on
the Great Lakes is so heavy. Whenever a cargo can be
shipped as well by water as by rail and there is no hurry for
delivery, it is shipped by water. However, because so much
of our freight must be rushed from place to place, the railroads
get the bulk of the inland traffic.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Railroad Company</span></div>

<p>The services of the railroad company embrace the hauling
of freight, the carrying of passengers, and the transporting of
express and of mail. The hauling of freight is the most
important item in the railroad business, about three-quarters
of the total income being derived from this source. Each
year over one billion tons of freight are turned over by
shippers to the railroads, who use almost two and one-half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
million freight cars to carry it. About one-half of this tonnage
is minerals, mainly ore and coal; about one-seventh
consists of manufactured articles; and one-twelfth of agricultural
products. Commodities are grouped into from ten
to fourteen classes, on each one of which the freight rate is
different from that of the others. By freight rate is meant
the cost of shipping a certain unit, usually 100 pounds
or a ton, from one place to another; it is dependent
on the distance. There are certain bulky commodities like
coal, livestock, lumber, grain, and cement, which are almost
always handled in carload lots. They are not included in
the freight classification, but have a special ex-class freight
rate. Freight rates depend also on whether the goods are
shipped by slow or <i>local</i> freight or by fast or <i>through</i> freight.</p>

<p>There are a hundred different kinds of papers used in
carrying on the railroad freight business. Only four of the
most important will be considered here. When a shipper
turns over his goods to the railroad company at its freight
depot, he gets from the agent a <i>receipt for freight</i>, which is
merely a receipt for the goods he has turned over. In the
ordinary course of business these receipts are exchanged at
the company's office for a <i>bill of lading</i> in triplicate. The
original and one copy are given to the shipper. The second
copy is kept by the railroad. This bill of lading may be
of two kinds, <i>straight</i> or <i>order</i>. If a straight bill of lading
is given, the original is sent to the person to whom the goods
are shipped, who is called the <i>consignee</i>, who on the presentation
of the bill of lading is entitled to the goods after
paying the charges. An order bill of lading is much like
a check, in that it can be assigned to another person. Like
the straight bill it states the name of the consignee or
the person for whom the goods are intended and his
address, but the consignee cannot get possession of the
goods until he has paid for them. To collect payment,
the shipper attaches to the order bill of lading a draft for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the amount of the goods and the freight, and through his
bank and the bank of the consignee the amount is collected.
The consignee then gets possession of the order bill of lading,
which entitles him to possession of the goods. This is
more fully explained on <a href="#Page_344">page 344</a>. The railroad's most
important paper is the <i>way bill</i>, which shows the conductor
or the agent of the company just what articles are included
in the shipment, so that it can be checked when unloaded.
When the goods arrive at their destination, the consignee
is notified and is sent a <i>freight bill</i> showing the freight
charges. When he presents his bill of lading and pays the
charges, the <i>freight bill</i> is receipted and the goods are his.</p>

<p>In quoting prices on goods, manufacturers and distributors
usually designate whether they will pay the freight or
whether it is to be paid by the consignee. In the latter case
the price is quoted f. o. b. at the place from which the goods
are shipped, which means freight on board at that point.
That is to say, if a distributor located at Detroit quotes his
automobiles f. o. b. Detroit, he means that he will see that
the goods get into the railroad company's hands at Detroit,
but that the consignee pays the freight from Detroit to the
destination. The latter is the common practice in shipping.</p>

<p>In the following exercises we shall treat the subject of
distribution under four heads:</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 259</b></div>

<div class='center'><br /><i>Oral</i></div>

<p>You are opening a grocery store. Remember that your
object is to sell the largest possible amount of goods.
Develop each of the following suggestions:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. What kind of location would you desire?</p>

<p>2. How would you have the front of your store painted?
Would you try to make it stand out from the rest?</p>

<p>3. Do you think it would pay you to have the interior newly
and brightly redecorated? To put in the best and brightest
lights?</p>

<p>4. What quality of stock would you select? The same for
all neighborhoods? Give your reasons. Would advertised
brands bring you more trade?</p>

<p>5. Do you think window display would pay? Would you
recommend freak or ordinary displays? Price-marked or non-price-marked?
Give your reasons.</p>

<p>6. Does the delivery wagon pay? Would it be advisable to
buy a new wagon and a good horse? What other considerations
would enter?</p>

<p>7. Would you sometimes cut the price of some necessity to
draw people? Give reasons for your answer.</p>

<p>8. Is it a good thing to have a general cut-price-sale to bring
customers to your store? Even if you lose money by it?</p>

<p>9. Would you give credit? Would the class of people you
served come into consideration?</p>

<p>10. Is the use of trading stamps and premiums good policy?</p>

<p>11. Why do you often find a meat market in connection with
a grocery?</p>

<p>12. There are two kinds of retail meat markets: (1) the one
that sells goods which can be retailed at a low price, and (2) the
one that sells superior goods at a higher price. Which policy
would you follow and why?</p>

<p>13. Could a retailer combine the two spoken of in (12)? Consider
cost, space, satisfaction of the customer.</p>

<p>14. Would you advertise by means of handbills? By circular
letters?</p>

<p>15. What would you do if another grocery opened across the
street from yours?</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 260</b></div>

<div class='center'><br /><i>Written</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. You have bought Burton &amp; Sanders' grocery at Fort Wayne,
Indiana. Send out a circular letter advertising the new White
Front Grocery and telling what the policy of the new management
will be. Explain that the opening sale will begin next Monday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and that a special feature of the sale will, be twenty pounds
of granulated sugar for eighty cents with a two dollar order.</p>

<p>2. At the same time have an article appear in a local newspaper,
telling that Burton &amp; Sanders have sold their store to

(a) Write an advertisement for one. <i>(b</i>) Apply for the position.</p>

<p>10. Write a short circular advertising an inexpensive novelty
that a grocer might sell. These circulars are to be wrapped
with purchases.</p>

<p>11. Peabody, Harper &amp; Co. write, confirming your order in
(8) and enclosing a straight bill of lading.</p>

<p>12. When the goods arrive, you find no tomatoes among them.
Write a complaint to the wholesale house.</p>

<p>13. Peabody, Harper &amp; Co. reply to your letter in (12), apologizing
for the mistake, explaining how it occurred (supply an
explanation), and telling you that they have sent one case by
express at their expense. The rest will follow by freight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>14. The tomatoes sent by freight do not arrive. Write to the
grocery company, asking the latter to send out a "tracer"; that
is, to request the railroad company to trace the goods on its lines.</p>

<p>15. The grocery company telephones the railroad company,
requesting the latter to trace the goods and to report. The
grocery company also writes a letter confirming its request. Write
the letter.</p>

<p>16. (<i>a</i>) The railroad company reports that by mistake the goods
were carried through to Lima, but that they are being returned
to Fort Wayne. (<i>b</i>) The grocery company informs you of the
developments and hopes that the delay has caused you no great
inconvenience. Write both letters.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 261</b></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. You wish to get a partner to open a meat market in connection
with your grocery. Write to a friend in Lafayette, Ind.,
who you think will be interested, proposing the plan. Tell him
of the opportunities, as you see them, of business in Fort Wayne
and the surrounding country. Tell him that with $4,000 additional
capital you and he could set up a much larger establishment,
invest in a motor wagon, and thus secure the trade of the
outlying districts.</p>

<p>2. Your friend replies that the proposal appeals strongly to
him, but that he has only $2,000 in cash. However, he holds a
mortgage for $2,000 on &mdash;&mdash; (state the location of the house) in
Lafayette, and, if he can sell the mortgage, he will be glad to

<p>7. He writes confirming your order, saying that the car is now
in the shipper's hands and that his bank has sent the order bill of
lading with draft attached to the First National Bank of your
city. Write the letter. (See <a href="#Page_344">page 344</a>.)</p>

<p>8. At the same time the shipper's bank sends a letter to the
First National Bank of your city enclosing the order bill of lading
with draft drawn on you for collection. A copy of this letter is
also mailed to you. Write it.</p>

and enclosing the bill of lading and a receipt for the correct
amount. You present your bill of lading, pay the freight charges,
and get your motor wagon. Write the letter the bank sends.</p>

<p>11. The automobile manufacturer has meanwhile received
through his bank a credit for the amount you paid for the car and
writes acknowledging its receipt. Write the letter.</p></div>

below and one-half of whom are to argue against it.</p>

<p>A certain grocer opened a store with the determination of
doing a strictly cash business, and of making no deliveries
unless the purchaser paid for the delivery. This was his
plan as suggested by <i>System:</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. To those who would carry their own purchases he sold
everything for cash much lower than any other grocer in town
sold it.</p>

<p>2. If the customer bought very bulky goods, or if he did not

delivery a certain percentage of the total of his cash purchases.
Yet the customer bought more cheaply than he could buy in any
other grocery in town.</p>

<p>3. Those who wished to pay once a month instead of at every

<i>Written</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. You are Thos. H. Peabody of Peabody, Harper &amp; Co.'s
wholesale grocery. Prepare a circular letter, announcing your
removal to a new building. The letter will be printed in imitation
of typewriting and the introduction filled in later on the
typewriter. Remember you are seeking patronage. Address
one letter to Walter T. Barth, 350 E. Water St., Milwaukee, Wis.</p>

<p>2. Write an advertisement to appear in the January number
of <i>The Grocer and Country Merchant</i>, a grocers' trade journal.
It will announce your change of location.</p>

<p>3. You receive an order from a retailer in which he asks for
a certain brand of coffee that you do not carry. Write a letter
telling him you do not handle that brand and offering him another.
Make the letter as courteous as possible.</p>

<p>4. Write an advertisement for (1) a bookkeeper; (2) a stenographer.</p>

<p>5. Answer (1) or (2) above.</p>

<p>6. Write an advertisement for a traveling salesman.</p>

<p>7. Answer (6) telling why you think you could sell groceries
although you have had no experience.</p>

<p>8. Write a circular letter to send to the trade setting forth
the merits of a new brand of canned fruit. Say that you are
offering the brand at a very attractive price in the expectation
that retailers will make it a leader. Write to Mr. Barth (1).</p>

<p>9. You have made a contract with the manufacturers of the
canned fruit mentioned in (8), by which you secure the exclusive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
sale but take the responsibility of advertising. Write to an advertising
agency, saying that you are considering a three months'
advertising campaign. Explain that you do not wish the expense
to exceed five thousand dollars.</p>

<p>10. The advertising agency replies that, as five thousand dollars
is a comparatively small sum for a campaign, it would suggest
that the advertising be confined to one class: street car, billboard,
newspaper, or magazine. Write the letter.</p>

<p>11. Notify the agency of your choice, giving your reasons.</p>

<p>12. Write a series of three letters to send to housewives, advertising
the canned fruit, with the purpose of having them ask
for this brand at their grocers': (1) Telling the name of the canned
fruit, its excellence, its price, and where it may be bought; (2)
Asking if the housewife has as yet bought any, and if she has not,
telling her she can get a sample at her grocer's on presentation of
this letter; (3) Asking how she liked the fruit and quoting a letter
of recommendation received from Mrs. A., who lives in the neighborhood.
Urge her to buy, but not too abruptly. A letter to a
woman should be fairly long. (See <a href="#Page_265">page 265</a>.)</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 265</b></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. For two months you have been without a credit man. You
wish to be very careful in your choice because of the importance
of the position. J. B. Wright of 439 Russell Ave., Indianapolis,
is a personal friend of yours. He has heard that you need a credit
man and he recommends Joseph Haddon, who worked for him
three years in that capacity until a year ago when he went to
Colorado because of the ill-health of his wife. Meanwhile, Mr.
Wright's son has been acting as his credit man. Mrs. Haddon
has now recovered, and her husband is anxious to get another
position. Reproduce Mr. Wright's letter.</p>

<p>2. Write the letter Mr. Wright sends Mr. Haddon in Colorado,
suggesting that the latter apply for the position.</p>

<p>3. At the same time Joseph Haddon writes, applying for the
position. Write the letter of application.</p>

<p>4. Write Mr. Haddon's letter thanking Mr. Wright for his
interest. Remember that the two men know each other.</p>

<p>5. Joseph Haddon, whom you have engaged, is proving to be
a very alert credit man. He has made a study of your credit
files and has discovered that you have a great many accounts of
long standing that ought to be collected. He prepares a courteous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
letter to send to the debtors, telling them that he has just been
made credit man and that he personally would like to get into
closer touch with their particular situation to find out how soon
he might expect a remittance from them, so that he could plan
the future of his department. Write the letter. (See <a href="#Page_254">page 254</a>.)</p>

<p>6. A number of retailers remit the amount that they owe.
Some explain their situation in detail, but a great many do not
respond to (5). Write another letter, still courteous, but more
emphatic than (5), to those who did not respond. (See <a href="#Page_255">page 255</a>.)</p>

<p>7. Still a number do not respond. Write a third letter, saying
that you will place the matter in the hands of your attorney
unless you receive a remittance within ten days.</p>

<p>8. Mr. Haddon discovers that there are about a hundred
retailers who used to be customers, but who have bought nothing
for about two years. He reports this to the sales manager, Mr.
James Woodworth, who writes a letter to the retailers to induce
them to send another order, using the canned fruit spoken of in
(8) of <a href="#Exercise_264">Exercise 264</a> as a means of interesting them.</p>

<p>9. Nathaniel Sears, a dealer in general merchandise at Joplin,
Mo., writes to you asking for an open account. He says that he
did a $10,000 business last year and that, apparently, sales this
year will be larger. He gives no references. You refer the matter
to Mr. Haddon, who looks up Mr. Sears in Bradstreet and then
writes to one of your salesmen at St. Louis, asking him to investigate
the financial standing of Mr. Sears. Write to the salesman.</p>

<p>10. After three days the salesman reports that Mr. Sears seems
to be doing a good business, but he thinks the dealer is living
beyond his means. He owes two wholesale houses $500 and $850
respectively; his property in Joplin is heavily mortgaged, and
yet he is making extensive improvements on his residence; his
son and his daughter are at expensive boarding schools. Write
the letter. Be exact in your information.</p>

<p>11. As Mr. Woodworth, write Mr. Sears a courteous letter,
refusing him credit but attempting to secure his cash business.</p>

<p>12. Charles Freeman, 141 Park Place, Newark, Ohio, writes
in answer to (5) saying that he is unable to pay his account of
$500. After the harvest his outstanding bills will be paid by the

<i>Oral</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Suppose you were starting a mail order business. Would
it make any difference in possible profits if your center of operations
were in a large or a small city? Give your reasons.</p>

<p>2. Would you try to be near good transportation?</p>

<p>3. What kind of stock would you advertise principally: bulky
articles or those easily handled? expensive goods or those of more
moderate price?</p>

<p>4. Your catalogue is your salesman. What would this statement
suggest about the cost of running your business as compared
with that of Peabody, Harper &amp; Co., who employ five salesmen?</p>

<p>5. How would you bring special attention to your leaders in
your catalogue?</p>

<p>6. Why is it advisable not to give your catalogue away free,
but to charge a nominal sum for it?</p>

<p>7. Would you sell as cheaply as you could or would you try
to sell for as high a price as possible even if you sold less?</p>

<p>8. Is it profitable for a mail order merchant to sell one spool
of thread or one pocket-knife? Consider the handling and the
packing.</p>

<p>9. Why can the mail order merchant sell more cheaply than
the country dealer?</p>

<p>
10. <i>a.</i> How is the parcel post favorable to the mail order dealer?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><i>b.</i> Why did the country merchant object so strenuously to the passage of the parcel post law?</span><br />
</p>

<p>11. Some distributors who handle only one kind of article sometimes
pay the freight. Would this plan be advisable for a mail
order house to adopt?</p>

<p>12. Since the purchaser pays the freight, is it advisable for
him to buy a large or a small order at one time?</p></div>

<p>2. Write, stating that in their catalogue No. 6, page 673,
Borroughs &amp; Brown list a washing machine such as you wish,
called the "Pride Swing" washing machine, No. 4-A-459. The
measurements as listed are: depth 13 inches, diameter 21 inches.
The price is $5.25. This is too small for your purpose. Ask if
they can supply you with the same style 30 inches in diameter.
Ask the price.</p>

<p>3. Borroughs &amp; Brown write that they have no such machine
in stock, but, since there have been many requests lately for a

<p>Conduct a transaction of your own, using the above as
a model, except in the method of payment.</p>


<div class='center'><b><span class="smcap">IV.&mdash;The Salesman</span></b></div>

<p>Salesmanship is a branch of distribution about which
many volumes have been written. We cannot consider it
minutely from the personal view of the salesman, but can
only touch upon it from the point of view of distribution.
The salesman is merely a force in distribution like
correspondence, circulars, and advertising. But the salesman
has the advantage over these in that he is able to
bring his personality to bear in the problem of getting
business. It is by means of his personality that the salesman
gets the attention and confidence of the customer,&mdash;a
thing which is extremely hard to do in a letter, a circular,
or an advertisement. Securing a buyer's confidence is very
important, because no suspicious customer has ever yet
bought anything.</p>

<p>In addition to a pleasing personality a good salesman must
have a wide and thorough knowledge of his wares. If he
does not know his goods, the sale drags; whereas, if he knows
everything good there is to be known about them, his enthusiasm
instills enthusiasm into the customer.</p>

<p>After bringing his knowledge and his enthusiasm into play,
he must next call on his perseverance and his tact; perseverance
to keep at the customer until he gets the order, and
tact to know in each case just how to go about getting the
order and just when to stop. Many salesmen talk too much;
many more do not talk enough.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 270</b><br /><br />

<i>Oral</i></div>

<p>In talking on any of the following subjects be sure you
know just what you are going to say before you begin, and
then say it clearly and convincingly. Don't say too much
and don't say too little. Just exactly how much you
should say no one can tell you. You must watch your
audience. If they look puzzled, give more details; if they
look bored, try shorter, more concise sentences, or bring
your talk to a close. After you have explained all your
points, sum them up briefly at the end. Remember that
your talk must, first, attract attention; second, hold the
interest; and third, create enthusiasm and desire to buy.</p>

<p>To supplement what facts you get from observation, study
advertisements and catalogues to get material for (9) to
(20) below:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Get up a talk to persuade a freshman or a group of freshmen
to subscribe to the school paper.</p>

<p>2. To persuade girls to contribute to a fund to be used to buy

home in your neighborhood.</p>

<p>5. Try to sell the manager of the baseball team a new line of
athletic goods.</p>

<p>6. Try to sell a set of Dickens' (or any other author's) works
to a boy who is not fond of reading. You must enjoy the books
that you recommend.</p>

<p>7. Try to sell the class or the teacher a new kind of loose
leaf note book for science or English work.</p>

<p>8. As an agent for the publishers try to sell this text book to
your English class or to your English teacher.</p>

<p>9. You are trying to sell an automobile to a farmer. By
means of concrete examples develop the following items into a
talk:<br />


<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><i>a.</i> The business opportunities to be gained.<br /></span>

<p>10. Get up a talk to sell a runabout to a physician who
has a small practice. Suppose that he owns a horse and a buggy.
Be tactful.</p>

<p>11. You are a salesman for an automobile house and are trying
to sell a gasoline car to a man who is partial to an electric car.
Meet the objections to the gasoline car and put forward its
advantages.</p>

Develop the following into a talk:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><i>a.</i> Ease of operation.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><i>b.</i> Noiselessness and comfort.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><i>c.</i> Elegant appearance.</span><br /></p>

<p>13. You are trying to sell the manager of a local express company
a motor truck. Gather all the data you can and present it
in a talk on why he should replace his horses and wagons with
motor trucks. Be as specific as possible.</p>

<p>14. Get up a talk showing why a man with considerable means
should trade his two year old car as part payment for the latest
model.</p>

<p>15. Get up a talk to sell a phonograph.</p>

<p>16. To sell an electric washing machine.</p>

<p>17. To sell a piano.</p>

<p>18. To sell a vacuum cleaner.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 271</b></div>

<p>The following paragraph was adapted from William C.
Freeman's <i>Advertising Talks</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>George Washington's Cherry Tree Story has served a good
purpose through all of these years. "I cannot tell a lie" is a phrase
that has been used in every schoolroom in America to impress
upon young minds the importance of truth telling. The phrase
is also serving its purpose outside the schoolroom. In all professions
and in all kinds of business, men know that in order to
make good they must tell the truth. There never was, in all the
history of the country, a greater movement than now toward
universal truth telling. There is not even that winking at "white"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
lies that used to prevail. The man who does not make a direct
statement, who does not earn a reputation for being honest, has
no chance of succeeding. Time was when the trickster was regarded
as shrewd and was accepted in the community as being
right both socially and commercially. To-day the man who has
money without a reputation for integrity is a bankrupt, as far as
real friends and public opinion are concerned. The expression
"I cannot tell a lie" has been changed to-day to "I will not tell
a lie even if the lie seems more expedient than the blunt truth."
So George Washington's Cherry Tree Story is as good to-day as
it ever was.</p></div>

Strengthen the impression you made on him by writing him a
letter summing up the important advantages of the motor truck.
Use the following extract from a letter:</p>

the place of three wagons and twelve horses. My route from
Waltham is so long that a pair of horses going over it one day has
to be laid off the next."</p>

<p>"This truck makes three trips each day. I have had it on the
road nearly four months and have covered over four thousand
(4,000) miles with no expense for repairs."</p>

<p>4. A prospective customer has lost interest. Try to arouse
him once more by telling him of a particularly good sale recently
made, or of a new model just received, or of a new device lately
perfected. Your object is to get him to inspect your cars again.</p>

<p>5. Write a letter to a wealthy man who bought one of your
cars two years ago, offering him half of what he paid for the car
in exchange for a new model. Make him see that it would be to
his advantage to accept the offer.</p>

<div class='center'>1</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Transportation is a great business as well as manufacturing or
farming. History tells us that very early people did not have a
settled home, but, when the grass began to give out in one part
of the country, several members of the community, perhaps whole
tribes, took their belongings on their backs and sought for a new
place to settle. It is reasonable to suppose that they wished to
keep up some sort of intercourse with their friends. At once
difficulties arose, since hostile tribes lived between them and their
old home. It was a brave man, indeed, who ventured to encounter
the dangers of the trip between the settlements. Such a set of
men arose in the peddlers, who set out alone or in caravans with
articles of produce or manufacture and braved the dangers even
of a desert to exchange what they carried for the produce of the
old home. This is the earliest form of transportation. Compare
this simple form with the modern railroad, steamship, and express
service.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

and, moreover, sold at attractive prices. Our consuls
abroad report that in all these essentials American dealers are
deficient and that British, French, and German manufacturers
fill the South American markets.</p>

<p>To these rivals must be added another, for, in spite of old South
American prejudices against Spain and Spanish goods, the Spaniards
are quietly regaining their footing in those republics of
whose trade a century ago the home country enjoyed the monopoly.
Her advantages, we know, are a common language and
familiarity with the ways of life and the tastes of the buyers.
Spain produces just the kind of wine, olive oil, and canned goods
that South America wants; she turns out the kind of paper, the
patterns of cotton goods, the styles of tools and implements,
the clothing, shoes, and weapons used in Latin America; and the
result is that she gets the trade. One-sixth, at least, of her entire
exports goes to her former possessions.</p></div>

parcel post. By its instrumentality gold, diamonds, minerals,
wool, feathers, saddlery, boots and shoes, confectionery, fruit,
plants, seed, butter and eggs suitably packed, and other farm
products are transported, and the producer and consumer have
been brought together. From the report of the Department of
Posts and Telegraphs we learn that the scheme has worked well,
is a recognized and popular feature of the postal system, and is
entirely feasible. The sparse settlements and widely scattered

is it to be applied? It would seem that there can be but one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
answer: there must be stern discipline for taking risks. There
must be thorough instruction as to what risks are and how to
avoid them, just such instruction as the "safety first" movement
is leading up to, but extended to every man in every department
of every road. In addition, the promise that no engineman will
be censured for losing or not making up time or for not running
fast when it is not considered safe to do so must be changed to
the positive, unequivocal statement that there will be a substantial
penalty for every case of running fast when it is not safe to
do so.&mdash;<i>Railway Age Gazette.</i></p></div>

<div class='center'><br />5</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>More and more attention, each year, is being given by the railroad
managers to the locating of new kinds of industry along their
lines. The roads in the West and the South nearly all have
efficient industrial departments, land departments, or immigration
departments. Their men seek out new industries, meet the
steamers to tempt immigrants into their region, arrange for the
purchase or rental of lands, and get together reports of the soil,
the products, and the advantages of any desired location. Perhaps
the greatest effort, however, is bent upon the location of
new factories along the route. In one year one southern railroad
induced more than seven hundred men to establish industries along
its lines, after the railroads had made complete and painstaking
investigation of all the conditions that would confront the prospective
manufacturers.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ADVERTISING</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Advertising</span> is one of the most vital forces in the problem
of distribution. Every advertisement is a salesman and is
written and sent out with the idea of doing the work of one.
It may bring in actual orders or it may merely do "missionary
work"; that is, it may introduce a certain article or
product and educate the people to see its advantages so that
when next they desire that particular sort of article, they
will order the one that they have seen advertised.</p>

<p>Many an article that has had practically no sale has by
means of an effective advertising campaign been brought to
a point of wide distribution and ready sale. How many
safety razors would the manufacturers sell if they had never
advertised their product? Very few. But when day after
day, everywhere a man looks&mdash;in street cars, newspapers,
magazines, and on billboards&mdash;he sees staring at him a
reason why he should use a safety razor, he soon comes to
feel that he needs one. It is just the same as though the
country were covered with salesmen who were constantly
after every one to get him to see the advantage of the safety
razor. The advertised articles may in themselves be no
better than the unadvertised brands, but advertising has
created a demand for the one over the other. The secret
of selling success is creating a demand.</p>

<p>The importance of advertising is demonstrated by an
experience which the city of Chicago had on Wednesday,
March 2, 1911. On the afternoon before, a dispute arose
between two newspapers and their printers, ending in a
temporary strike of the printers. As a result, all papers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
published on March 2 contained only four pages each, in
contrast to the usual twenty-four, because they contained
not a single advertisement. Fortunately, the strike lasted
only one day, as the local printers were at once reprimanded
by the International Typographical Union. But the losses
that newspapers and retail business men suffered on this one
day convinced them of the power of advertising. Street
cars, downtown streets, and department stores were almost
empty. To be sure, billboards still proclaimed their wares,
but, as soon as newspaper advertising ceased, the great
mass of shopping stopped.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 280</b><br /><br />

<i>Oral</i></div>

<p>Discuss the value of each of the following as forms of
advertising:</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
1. Location.<br />
2. Furnishings of the office or the store.<br />
3. Letter headings.<br />
4. Window displays.<br />
5. Electric (or other) signs.<br />
6. Moving electric signs.<br />
7. Colors (especially reds, greens, and yellows) as against black and white.<br />
8. White lettering on a black background.<br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 281</b></div>

<p>Fundamentally, the same principles apply to the advertisement
as apply to the sales letter (See <a href="#Page_230">page 230</a>). First of
all, you must look at your goods from the standpoint of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
the user; see his gain in buying rather than your profit in
selling. Your products, then, will probably fall into one
of the following general classes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Something entirely new for which you must create a
demand by showing its advantage to the buyer, arousing his
sense of need and, consequently, his desire to possess.</p>

<p>2. Something new but filling a long-felt need&mdash;"Just what
you've been looking for"&mdash;the value of which will appeal to the
buyer almost as soon as the product is explained. Comparison
with the article that now imperfectly fills the want suggests itself.</p>

<p>3. A new brand of an old staple, like crackers, of which the
superiority must be dwelt upon to induce buyers to ask for it.
Even after the article is selling well, continuous advertising is
necessary to keep the name before the public.</p></div>

<p>A paying advertisement appeals to a large class of people
or, better still, to several classes. For a moment let us
analyze a few of the appeals to which almost every one
responds; let us consider the reasons back of our purchases.
Why do we buy one article and not another? We buy it
first, perhaps, because we need it or think we need it; second,
because we think it will taste good or be comfortable or
good-looking or because it will afford us amusement; third,
because we think it is better, though possibly more expensive,
than any other brand on the market, and our pride
or our desire to emulate responds to it; fourth, because we
think it is good for our health or our safety; and, fifth,
because we shall save money or make money thereby.
Summing up, we may say that the motives to which
appeals may safely be made are:</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
1. Need, conscious or unconscious (usefulness, quality, or durability).<br />
2. Comfort, amusement, or appetite.<br />
3. Pride, desire to emulate, or vanity.<br />
4. Safety (of health or personal possessions).<br />
5. Economy or gain.<br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>Clip from magazines and bring to class good advertisements
that appeal to the motives named above. Try to
find those advertisements that make an appeal to only one
motive in one advertisement.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 282</b></div>

<p>The following catch phrases have been taken from advertisements
in various places. Tell (1) whether their appeal
is general; (2) whether they induce one to buy; and (3) if
they do, which of the motives given above have been used
by the advertiser. Frequently more than one motive is
used in one advertisement.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. For a delicatessen store: Good things to eat.</p>

<p>2. For a chewing gum: The taste lasts.</p>

<p>4. For a refrigerator: Are you poisoning your family?</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 283</b></div>

<p>Bring to class two advertisements containing catch phrases
that you think are good. To which of the motives given
above does each appeal?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 284</b></div>

<p>Bring in two advertisements of articles that have suggestive
names. What is the value of a suggestive name?</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 285&mdash;Good and Bad Headlines</b></div>

<p>A good headline has the following qualities:</p>

<p>First, it should be short. Professor Walter Dill Scott
determined by experiments that the average person can
ordinarily attend to only about four visual objects at the
same time&mdash;four letters, four words, four simple pictures,
or four geometrical figures. As the headline of an advertisement
is intended to be taken in at one glance, it should,
therefore, be not longer than four words&mdash;preferably less,
provided the interest of the phrase is the same. Short words,
too, can be taken in more readily than long words.</p>

<p>Second, the best headline is a command. People instinctively
obey a command, unless it is so worded that they
rebel against the manner of expression.</p>

<p>Third, a good headline is suggestive. It touches upon
the things that the reader is thinking about. It shows that
the article that is offered for sale has a close connection
with the interests that absorb the reader's mind. It is a
direct answer to his thoughts, feelings, hopes, or worries.</p>

<p>The following headlines were taken from the advertisements
in one issue of a magazine. Judge of their effectiveness,
using the three principles given above as a basis for
your decision:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">1. Get That Job!</span><br />

14. Our Seeds Grow.<br />
15. That Raise! (Sub-heading in smaller type: What Would a Raise in Salary Mean to You?)<br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 286</b></div>

<p>Some advertisers choose headlines merely for the purpose
of attracting attention, forgetting that the headline should
suggest what the following illustration and text explain.
A few years ago a well-known automobile company ran an
advertisement with the headline <i>$1000 Worth of Folly</i>. The
headline was followed by a picture of the automobile. The
advertisement was intended to convey the idea that, as this
car might be bought for $3000, any one paying $4000 for an
automobile was foolishly squandering $1000. As a matter
of fact, the only suggestion that the reader got from the
advertisement was that any one who paid $1000 for the
illustrated car would be a fool.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Bring to class an advertisement in which the headline has
no connection with the rest of the advertisement, being used
merely to catch the attention.</p>

<p>2. Find an advertisement in which the headline suggests the
opposite of what the advertisement is intended to convey.</p>

<p>3. How might either advertisement be improved?</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 287</b></div>

<p>Still-life advertisements are not interesting. The picture
of a furnace, or a typewriter, or a house attracts less attention
than the same objects with human beings represented
moving in the picture.</p>

<p>Bring to class two advertisements of the same kind of
article, in one of which a still-life illustration is used and
in the other of which human beings are used to center the
attention upon the article that is offered for sale.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 288</b></div>

<p>Bring to class (1) an advertisement that is not good because
it contains too much&mdash;lacks a center upon which the
attention naturally focuses; and (2) an advertisement that
is good because it has a definitely defined center of attraction.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 289</b></div>

<p>Bring to class an advertisement in which the principle of
balance is used to advantage, two illustrations, one on each
side of the text, being used to convey one impression.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 290</b></div>

<p>In writing the following, try to embody the principles that

<p>8. A half-page advertisement by the Hudson Cereal Company,
110 Hudson St., New York, of their Nervo-Cereal Coffee contains
the item: "Can you thread a needle, holding the thread one
inch from the end? If you cannot, you are nervous. Is coffee
to blame?" Exploit the aroma and flavor of the cereal coffee.</p>

<p>9. The Central Packing Company is running a series of advertisements
of their Premium Extract of Beef. This one is to appear
just before Thanksgiving. Entitle it "Four Delicious Dishes

Premium Extract for the right flavor. At the end sum up the
merits of Premium Extract and mention the silver premiums
given with the certificates under the metal caps.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 292</b></div>

<p>The following paragraph is taken from Professor Scott's
<i>Theory of Advertising</i>. What is the subject of the paragraph?
Is there a topic sentence? By what plan is the paragraph
developed?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Many of those who use illustrations for their advertisements
follow the philosophy of the Irish boy who said that he liked to
stub his toe because it felt so good when it stopped hurting. Many
of us are unable to see how the boy had made any gain after it
was all over, but he was satisfied, and that was sufficient. The
philosophic disciples of the Irish boy are found in advertisers who
have certain things to dispose of which will not do certain harmful
things. First they choose an illustration which will make you
believe that what they have to sell is just what you do not want,
and then in the text they try to overcome this false impression
and to show you that what they have to offer is not so bad after
all. Most of us are unable to see how the advertiser has gained,
even if he has succeeded in giving us logical proof that his goods
are not so bad as we were at first led to think. We are not logically
inclined, and we take the illustration and the text, and we
combine the two. The best that the text can do is to destroy
the evil effect of the illustration. Of course, when we read in
the text that the illustration does not correctly represent the
goods, we ought to discard the illustration entirely and think
only of the text, but, unfortunately, we are not constructed in
that way. The impression made by the illustration and that
made by the text fuse and form a whole which is the result formed
by these two elements.</p></div>

<p>We have now been in our new location somewhat over a month.
Our business has been all that we expected; in some departments,
indeed, there is an increase, notably in the neckwear, ready-to-wear
clothes, hats, and tailoring departments.</p>

<p>Naturally, we had an abundance of faith in our new location;
nevertheless, we must confess that there were times when we had
anxious moments. We discovered, however, that our moving

minds of the people there was but one thought&mdash;success for
Michigan Avenue.</p>

<p>We have always felt that there was a closer bond of sympathy

buyer and seller. The unusual interest taken in our new store
and in our success has more than confirmed us in this impression.
Our experience during the last forty days has really made life
worth living.</p>

<p>The minds of hundreds of our customers have reverted to the

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>REAL ESTATE AND INSURANCE</div>


<p>Lands, buildings, and houses are called real property or real
estate, and the business pertaining to them, the real estate
business. Every one of us has more or less to do with this
business. If we do not own property, we pay <i>rent</i>. Rent
is the money paid for the use of a piece of land, or a building,
or part of a building, and is usually paid at certain stated
intervals of time&mdash;monthly, for example. The owner of
the building is called the <i>landlord;</i> the one who rents, the
<i>tenant</i>. Sometimes there is no condition as to how long
a tenant shall remain in one place and pay rent, but, as a
rule, the landlord requires the tenant to sign a <i>lease</i>. This
is a contract between the landlord and the tenant, stating
that in consideration of the landlord's furnishing the tenant
a place in which to live with certain conveniences&mdash;such
as heat, hot water, and other services&mdash;the tenant agrees
to pay rent for a certain length of time, usually a year or
more. If the tenant moves out before his lease expires and
refuses to pay the rent, he breaks the contract and, as is
usually the case when a contract is broken, a lawsuit may
follow. In large cities where land is in some places very
valuable, owners may not care to sell the property on which
others wish to build, but lease it to the builders for a certain
term of years, usually ninety-nine years.</p>

<p>Suppose you no longer wish to pay rent, but to own the
house in which you live. If you buy a piece of property
from John Smith and pay him your money for it, you wish
to be assured that after a few months John Smith will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
come to you and claim the property as his. To protect
you John Smith gives you a <i>deed</i> to the property. A deed is
a contract between the buyer and the seller of the property.
It states that, in consideration of the buyer's paying a certain
stipulated sum of money, the seller releases and conveys
the property to the buyer. This deed shows that you now
own the property. At the same time you should receive a
<i>clear title</i> to the property; that is, you wish to be sure that
no one else has a claim on the property. If John Smith
guarantees that the title is clear, he gives you a <i>warranty
deed</i> for the property, in which he will "warrant and defend
the same against all lawful claims whatsoever." If, however,
he simply turns over the property to you as it stands,
he gives you a <i>quitclaim deed</i>, in which he relinquishes or
quits all his interest in it. If you have no debts on the
property, you own it in <i>fee simple</i>.</p>

<p>Very often in buying property, the purchaser pays only
a part of the purchase price himself, paying for the balance
by borrowing the necessary amount from a third party.
For example, if the house you bought from John Smith cost
$6,000 and you had only $4,000, you would be forced to
borrow the other $2,000 to pay John Smith. You would
then go to your bank or to some person who had money to
invest and would borrow the required amount, and to
guarantee that you would pay the money back, you would
give a <i>mortgage</i> on the property. A mortgage is a contract
which states that, in consideration of one party's giving
the second party a certain sum of money, the second party
agrees to pay interest on that money at a stipulated rate,
and at the end of a certain length of time agrees to pay the
money back; and that, in case the second party does not
pay back the amount at the end of the time, the first party
is empowered to take possession of the property, to sell it,
and to get the amount due him. This last procedure is
called <i>foreclosing the mortgage</i>. It is a common practice to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
mortgage property; almost all the property in a city is
mortgaged.</p>

<p>Some men and firms make a special business of transferring
property, buying and selling it for others, making leases,
and collecting rents. They are called real estate agents,
and for their services get a <i>commission</i>, which is a certain
percentage of the purchase or the selling price and a certain
percentage of the amount of rent collected. This percentage
varies according to whether the amount of money
involved is large or small, the percentage being larger when
small sums of money are involved than when large sums
are involved.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 296</b><br /><br />

<i>Oral</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Suppose that you are a landlord and that in your lease no
mention is made of giving your tenants janitor service, but you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
yourself take care of the furnace. Other landlords in the block
supply janitor service. After one of your tenants has moved in,
he demands that the back porch be scrubbed once a week and
the garbage emptied daily. What would you do? Consider the
points for and against.</p>

<p>2. Suppose some boys playing ball on the street break a plate
glass window in the store you own. Would you expect your
tenant to pay for repairs?</p></div>

<div class='center'><i>Written</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>3. Write to Francis L. Russell, a real estate agent, asking his
terms for collecting the rent of &mdash;&mdash; (tell the location of the
house, the number of the tenants, and the rent you receive).</p>

<p>4. As if you were Francis L. Russell write a reply, saying that
you will undertake the collection for a commission of 5%.</p>

<p>5. Imagine you are a tenant in the same building. The
kitchen sink cannot be used in your flat because of a stoppage
in the plumbing. You have told the agent once. Write him
(see 3) again, stating that unless he sends a plumber you will not
pay your next month's rent. (Is there any reason for writing
this, rather than telephoning it?)</p>

<p>6. The plumber has submitted a bill of $5.98 for the repairs
suggested in (5). The agent writes to the landlord, enclosing a
check for the rent that he has collected, less the amount of the
plumber's bill and his commission.</p>

<p>7. You are a lawyer. Write to the landlord, informing him
that the mortgage which your client holds against the landlord's
property expires in thirty days. Ask the landlord whether he
expects to pay the money or whether he wishes a renewal of the
loan for three years. Your client is willing to give such a renewal.</p>

<p>8. The landlord replies that he is enclosing $100 to pay the
interest due on the mortgage and that he desires a renewal of the
loan. If the lawyer will prepare the papers, he will come to sign
them at the specified time. Write the letter.</p>

<p>9. You are an insurance agent. Write to the landlord that
the fire insurance on his property expires in sixty days. Ask him
to allow you to write a new policy. Inform him that the rate
now will be 3% instead of if 1% as it was formerly, because a
garage has been erected one door north of his property. (Why
should the rate be higher?)</p>

<p>10. One of the tenants has paid no rent for two months. You
decide that he never will be able to pay. As landlord you make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
out and deliver to him a <i>Five days' notice of removal</i>. At the same
time, you write a letter to your lawyer, explaining the state of
affairs and asking him to take charge of enforcing the notice.
(This means that if the tenant does not move, the case must come
up in court. If it is decided in the landlord's favor, the tenant
must move. If he refuses, the lawyer engages a constable to eject
him.) Write the letter.</p>

<p>11. Francis L. Russell writes three short advertisements, offering
for sale (1) a large 12 room residence, mortgage $6,000, price
$15,000; (2) a 3 apartment building, clear, price $16,000; (3) a
large 12 apartment building, mortgage $25,000, price $41,000, terms
to suit. Where would you advertise? Write the advertisements.</p>

<p>12. You get inquiries about all of the above. Write answers
describing the buildings more fully, and make appointments with
the writers to inspect the property.</p>

<p>13. A man is interested in the 12 flat building, but he has only
$10,000. Offer him the property for $40,000 on these terms:
$10,000 down, a first mortgage for $20,000 to run 10 years at 5%,
and a second mortgage for $10,000 to run 5 years at 5&frac12;%, $2,000
to be paid each year with interest. Make it as attractive as
possible. Tell him you will arrange for the mortgages.</p>

<p>14. (<i>a</i>) Write to your bank, the First National, and explain
that, although the first mortgage on the 12 flat building for $25,000
still has 3 years to run, you would like to arrange for a 10 year
mortgage for $20,000, if your prospective buyer takes the property.
(<i>b</i>) Write to George R. Scott, who owns the building, offering him
the second mortgage. Explain that although it is a second mortgage
the fact that $2,000 of the principal is paid each year makes
it attractive. (How would the owner benefit if the buyer failed
to make his payments after 2 years?) Sign yourself Francis L.
Russell.</p>

<p>15. You have put through the deal. Write to the new owner,
offering to take care of the renting for a commission equal to 2&frac12;%
of the amount collected.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Exercise 297&mdash;Farm Lands</b></div>

<p>1. You own a large tract of land in the South, West, or
Southwest. Choose your own locality. Prepare a pamphlet
setting forth the advantages of this particular spot in a
series of paragraphs: (1) scenery, (2) climate and healthfulness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
(3) crops, (4) profits from the crops, (5) price of
labor, (6) chances for pleasure, e.g., hunting, fishing, etc.,
(7) transportation facilities, (8) price of the land. Use a
firm name and address.</p>

<p>2. Arrange and punctuate:</p>

<p>What advantage would there be in including such a letter
as (2) in the booklet spoken of in (1)?</p>

<p>3. To prove the possibilities of the land spoken of in (1),
you intend to start a model farm. Advertise for a farmer.
Your plan is to give him 60 acres to develop for himself, in
return for which he shall demonstrate the possibilities of
the land.</p>

<p>4. Write a letter applying for the position. You must
have farming experience, some money, a knowledge of crops,
and a good deal of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>5. Write an advertisement of your land for a big newspaper.
Exploit its most striking features, especially the
price. Study such advertisements before you write
yours.</p>

<p>6. Reproduce a letter you received in answer to (5),
asking for more information concerning the lands.</p>

<p>7. Write the reply to (6). Say you are enclosing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>

(3); and induce the inquirer to become a purchaser.</p>

<p>8. Prepare a series of three follow-up letters to be sent out
to prospective purchasers who write as in (6) but who do
not answer your letter in (7). Make each letter set forth
one of the following advantages of buying a piece of your
land: (1) The profits from the crops are large; (2) The
conditions are ideal&mdash;mention climate, water, neighbors,
transportation; (3) It is a good investment, since the land
will certainly rise in value&mdash;tell of other land in the neighborhood
that has risen in value within the last year. Arrange
the letters in the order that you think will be most effective.</p>

the fire insurance policy? Why must the amount of insurance
equal or exceed the amount of the mortgage?</p></div>

<div class='center'><i>Written</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. You are an insurance agent. A man came to your office
to-day to inquire about a life insurance policy. Write him a letter,
repeating what you told him, advocating his taking out a straight
life policy.</p>

<p>2. A new building has just been erected in your neighborhood.
Write to the owner, soliciting him to let you write the fire insurance
policy.</p>

<p>3. Write to a man who rides downtown on the train every
day. Convince him that he needs to take out an accident insurance
policy. Point out that the premium is only $25 a year. If
the man is injured he will receive $25 weekly; if he is killed by
accident, his beneficiary will receive $5,000; if he is killed on a
train or in an elevator, $10,000.</p>

<p>4. Write to one of your clients, informing him that the premium
on his life insurance policy falls due in ten days.</p>

<p>5. Write to another of your clients, informing him that the
insurance on his property runs out in ten days. Inform him that,
if he wishes the policy renewed, he should let you know at once
and remit the premium.</p>

<p>6. From the client mentioned in (5) you receive a letter in
which he explains that the paint store which formerly adjoined
his property has been replaced by a grocery. He would like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
new policy at a lower rate. Reproduce the letter. A paint store
is insured at the highest, or hazard, rate. The rate on property
adjoining a paint store would also be very high.</p>

<p>7. You investigate the matter and find that the facts are as
stated in (6). Write your client, offering him a rate of 1&frac12;% and
enclosing a bill for $45.</p>

<p>8. He replies that, since the risk of fire is now so much less,
he wishes to take only $2,000 worth of insurance. He asks you to
write such a policy, and he encloses his check for $30. Write the
letter.</p>

<p>9. A man writes to you, saying that he wishes to take out an
endowment policy for his fifteen year old daughter, who has
already been examined. He wishes to give the insurance to her

<span class="smcap">Must Reform our Farming</span></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The average yield of wheat in the United States for the five
years ending in 1910 was eight-tenths of a bushel per acre more
than in the five years ending in 1905, but it was less than four-tenths
of a bushel more than for the ten ending in 1900. The average
corn product for the ten years ending in 1910 was a little less than
for the ten years ending in 1875. Thirty-five years had not advanced
us a step. European countries&mdash;Great Britain, France,
Germany&mdash;with inferior soils and less favorable climate produce
crops practically double our own. In our studies of conservation
we find no waste comparable, either in magnitude or importance,
to this. The farm will fail, and the foundations of our prosperity
be undermined, unless agriculture is reformed. The percentage
of our people actively engaged in farming had fallen from 47.36
in 1870 to an estimated 32 in 1910. Every man on the farm to-day
must produce food for two mouths against one forty years ago.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Farming Specials</span></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>One of the latest and most successful activities of the railroads
is the practice of carrying knowledge of the best farming methods
to the farmers by means of special trains equipped like agricultural
colleges. These trains, bearing experts and all the equipment
for exhibiting the new methods of agriculture, bring the knowledge
to the farmers free, and the railroads are glad to give it, for every
bit of knowledge comes back to them in a hundred fold profit in
freight. In the summer eager audiences all over the country
listen to the preaching of better methods and larger crops. Dozens
of special trains travel through the agricultural regions disseminating
information. The "Breakfast Bacon Special" has been run
to encourage Iowa farmers to raise more hogs to take advantage
of the high price of bacon. The Cotton Belt Route southwest
of St. Louis runs the "Squealer Special" to prove to the Arkansas
and Panhandle farmers the money-making advantages of blooded
hogs over the razor-back variety. Down the Mississippi Valley
the Illinois Central sends the "Boll Weevil Special" to conduct
a campaign against that pest. The Harriman lines have six
trains operating in California every year. In one year they visited
more than seventy-five thousand people. Better farming specials
run in practically every state south of the Ohio and Potomac and
west of the Mississippi. The New York Central also has two
trains in operation in New York.&mdash;<i>The Business Almanac.</i></p></div>

<div class='center'><br />3</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A large proportion of farmers give little or no attention to the
selection of seed; yet it has been demonstrated that a careful
selection would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the total
value of the crops. If, for example, a variety of wheat were
developed capable of producing one more kernel to the head, it
would mean an addition, so Burbank says, of 15,000,000 bushels
to our average wheat crop. It is possible, however, to do even
more than this. At the Minnesota station a variety, selected for
ten years according to a definite principle, yielded twenty-five
per cent more than the parent variety. Applied to our average
crop, that increase would amount to 185,000,000 bushels, worth
about $140,000,000. As for corn, it has been officially stated that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
our average yield could easily be doubled. After exhaustive experiments
the Department of Agriculture says that by merely testing
individual ears of seed corn and rejecting those of low vitality an
average yield of nearly fourteen per cent could be secured, adding
about $200,000,000 to the value of the crop. Does scientific seed
selection seem worth while?&mdash;<i>The Wall Street Journal.</i></p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BANKING</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Imagine</span> that you are a druggist in a small town. Suppose
that a woman comes in to buy two ounces of camphor
and in exchange gives you three eggs. In a few moments,
perhaps, a man enters to buy a safety razor and brings with
him wheat enough to pay the bill. Another, again, wishes
to trade a turkey for a fountain pen. You can readily see
the inconvenience to which you would be put in such exchange
of actual commodities; yet this was the method used
in primitive times, a method called <i>barter</i>.</p>

<p>To overcome the inconvenience of barter, as civilization
advanced, it became necessary to establish a common
medium of exchange, which could be accepted for anything
one had to sell and with which one could buy anything he
wished. This is what we call <i>money</i>. To meet the requirements,
money must not be bulky, must be durable, and must
not readily change in value. In civilized countries gold and
silver are the bases of exchange.</p>

<p>But gold and silver are heavy and inconvenient to carry
about in large, or for that matter in small, quantities, and
for convenience the following kinds of paper money have
been established:</p>

<p>1. <i>Gold Certificates</i> are issued with the government's guarantee
that there is gold deposited in the Treasury equal to
the amount of the face of the bill. At any time the one holding
such a bill may demand of the Treasury that he receive
gold for it.</p>

<p>2. <i>Silver Certificates</i> are similar to gold certificates, except
that silver is deposited in the Treasury instead of gold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>United States Treasury Notes</i> are promissory notes of
the government to pay the sum indicated. They are not
payable on demand.</p>

<p>4. <i>National Bank Notes</i> are promissory notes issued by the
national banks and are payable on demand of the bearer.
Before a national bank may issue such notes, it must own
United States government bonds of at least the amount for
which it issues notes. These bonds are held by the Treasurer
of the United States as security that the bank will pay
its notes. According to the Owen Glass Bill, passed in
December of 1913, national bank notes may at the option
of the banks be gradually withdrawn from circulation.</p>

<div class='center'><b>Credit</b></div>

<p><i>Credit</i> is a promise to pay at some future time for a thing
which you receive now. Its use is probably as old as the
practice of exchange and quite as important. The simplest
and most extensive form of credit is "book" credit, such as
you get at the grocer's or butcher's or at the department
store. To explain a little more complex kind of credit:
Suppose you owe Smith one hundred dollars. At the same
time Smith owes Jones one hundred dollars. Because you
owe Smith, he may give Jones an order to collect the money
from you. With this order Jones may pay his lawyer, let
us say. Perhaps the lawyer has bought a bill of goods from
you. He pays you with the same order. You destroy the
"note," and thus four actual transactions have been taken
care of without the use of any money. The business institution
which deals especially with credits is the bank.</p>

<div class='center'><b>Banks</b></div>

<p>A bank which fulfills every banking function must have
these three departments: (1) the commercial department,
(2) the savings department, (3) the trust department. Some
institutions specialize in one department more than in either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
of the others, and thus, taking the name from their principal
function, banks are known as follows: (i) commercial
banks or banks of deposit, (2) savings banks, (3) trust
companies.</p>

<div class='center'><b>Banks of Deposit</b></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/gs340.png" width="337" height="400" alt="Deposit slip" title="" />
</div>

<p>Banks of deposit or commercial banks are business men's
banks. Their two principal functions are (1) receiving money
for safe-keeping on deposit, and (2) loaning money to business
men at interest. The deposit function is based on
confidence and credit. The business man takes his money to
the bank not only because it is convenient for him to do so,
but also because he
has confidence that
the money will be
more carefully protected
than if he kept it
in his own possession.
In depositing his
money in the bank,
the business man uses
a <i>deposit slip</i> such as
the one illustrated
here. The teller puts
down the amount in
the <i>bank book</i> of the
depositor, who is credited
with that amount
on the bank's books. He is entitled to draw just that much
actual cash or that much credit in the form of <i>checks</i>. (See
<a href="#Page_339">page 339</a>.) Most firms do not deposit a sum of money and
then promptly draw it out again in the form of checks to
pay current liabilities, but maintain a fairly steady balance
in the bank. On large average monthly balances most
banks allow interest, varying from one per cent on balances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
of one thousand dollars to three per cent on balances of
ten thousand dollars or more.</p>

<div class='center'><b>Discount</b></div>

<p>Because a large bank has many depositors, the aggregate
of all the balances makes a considerable sum of money.
Bankers have learned by experience just what proportion
of their deposits they can depend on to remain steadily on
deposit as a balance, and thus they know what proportion
of their deposits it is safe to use for the purpose of <i>discount</i>.
The simplest case of the discount function is the discount
of a promissory note. In the note shown in the illustration
after ninety days John H. Blodgett will receive from Lucius
Thomas five hundred dollars with interest. But perhaps
Blodgett cannot wait ninety days for his money. In this
case, he takes the note to his banker, who will pay him the
five hundred dollars less a certain percentage or discount,
which is the bank's profit on the transaction. The bank
then collects the note when it becomes due.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/gs341.png" width="600" height="249" alt="Promissory Note" title="" />
<span class='caption'><span class='smcap'>Promissary Note</span></span></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Collateral</b></div>
<p>Instead of cashing a note held by one of its customers, the
bank may itself loan money at interest for a short period
of thirty, sixty, or ninety days, taking the note of the business<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
man to whom the money is loaned. In most cases,
however, unless the bank knows the business man well, a certain
amount of <i>collateral</i> is demanded as an assurance that
the borrower will pay the loan when it becomes due. The
amount of collateral deposited with the bank is usually 10%
to 25% in excess of the amount loaned, and it may take the
form of stocks or bonds; mortgages on real estate; liens on
stock, fixtures, or personal property; or warehouse receipts.
When the amount borrowed is paid, the collateral is returned;
if it is not paid within a reasonable time, the collateral
is sold, and the amount loaned, with interest to date,
is taken from the proceeds.</p>

<p>There are, of course, other functions of banks of deposit
practised quite generally by all banks, and these will be explained
later. The functions just described, however, distinguish
banks of deposit in a general way from the other
two classes.</p>

<div class='center'><b>Savings Banks</b></div>

<p>A savings bank accepts from its depositors small amounts
of money which are not subject to withdrawal by check, but
on which it pays a low rate of interest. As a general rule,
an account may be opened with one dollar; and when the
initial deposit is made, the depositor is furnished with a pass
book, similar to the bank book, in which further deposits,
interest credits, and withdrawals are recorded. Interest is
compounded every four or six months, and money must, as
a general rule, remain on deposit until an interest payment
date before the depositor receives any interest on it. The
usual rate of interest is three per cent, although four is often
paid. Frequently, before banks allow deposits to be withdrawn,
they demand a certain number of days' notice,
usually thirty. It is well to investigate the conditions under
which the depositor places his money in the safe-keeping of
the bank, because the withdrawal requirements are often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
stringent. Because of the stability of this class of deposit,
banks are always anxious to increase their savings accounts,
as a large proportion of the funds may be used for loans.</p>

<p>A form of the savings bank established in the United States
in 1911 is the postal savings bank, in which the post-office
is made the depository for savings. The post-office in the
town deposits its funds in the local national or state bank,
which, as security for safe-keeping, must deposit with the
Treasurer of the United States bonds at least equal in value
to the amount of savings deposited in the bank. Postal
savings banks are practically absolutely safe, because, if the
bank which takes care of the funds should fail, the bonds
may be sold, so that the savers will receive their money.
From deposits made in the postal savings bank, the return
to the depositor is only two per cent, whereas the return
from deposits made in the bank's own savings department is
three, three and a half, and sometimes four per cent.</p>

<div class='center'><b>Trust Companies</b><br />

<i>The Richards' Baby Stocking Fund</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A miner named Richards was killed in an accident in an Alaska
mine. Among his possessions were found a number of letters and
a baby stocking containing a little gold dust. The letters told
that Richards had a little six-year-old daughter, who was now left
destitute. The rough miners made up a fund of $2,500 in gold
dust, depositing it with the United States Commissioner of the
Territory of Alaska, to be held by him until the proper disposition
of it could be made. A <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'committe'">committee</ins> was appointed, who agreed that
one hundred dollars a year for ten years should be used to give
the child a common school education, and then five hundred dollars
each year to give her a college education. A legal guardian
was appointed, and the Kansas City Trust Company asked to act
as co-guardian to invest the money and make the required remittances.
The funds were first deposited by the commissioner in a
bank in Portland, which sent them to the Kansas City Trust Company.
Correspondence was of course carried on at the same time,
the Kansas City Trust Company agreeing to accept the trust without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
remuneration. They have invested the money in five per cent
bonds, thus increasing the fund yearly.</p></div>

<p>This is called a <i>trust</i> because the money is entrusted for
safe-keeping and investment to the bank, which is called the
<i>trustee</i>. A bank may also become the trustee for property
left at the death of a person, both when there is a will and
when there is none. When there is no will and the bank takes
charge of the affairs of the deceased, the bank is called the
<i>administrator;</i> when there is a will, the <i>executor</i>. Another
important function of the trust company is acting as <i>receiver</i>
for a company which has failed; that is, adjusting the company's
affairs in the way fairest both to the stockholders
and to the company's creditors. The trust company often
acts, also, as <i>agent</i> for its clients' property, performing the
same duties as a real estate agent.</p>

<div class='center'><b>Form of Remittance</b></div>

<p>Banks as a class are distinguished one from the other
according as they specialize in one or more of the functions
described above. However, there are certain services that
all banks perform and certain facilities that they all offer
in connection with the payment of money from one person
to another. These concern the forms of remittance.</p>

<p>If you have studied business arithmetic or bookkeeping,
you very likely know the definite forms that are used. At
all events, you know that currency should never go through
the mails. The following is a brief review of the more
important forms that may be used. Study the illustrations
carefully, noticing particularly the similarity of form in all.
Uniformity in such matters is desirable because it saves
time as well as misunderstandings. The forms we shall
consider are:</p>

<div class='blockquot2'>
1. The check<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>a.</i> Personal</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>b.</i> Certified</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>2. The money order<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>a.</i> Express</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>b.</i> Postal</span><br />
3. The bank draft<br />
4. The time draft<br />
5. The sight draft<br />
</div>

<p><i>Check.</i>&mdash;A check is a written order on a bank, signed by
a depositor, directing the bank to pay a certain person a
certain sum of money. When the bank pays the order, it
deducts the amount from the depositor's account. The
one who signs the check is called the <i>drawer</i> or maker; the
person to whom or to whose order a check is made payable
is called the <i>payee;</i> the bank on which a check is drawn is
called the <i>drawee</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/gs345.png" width="600" height="234" alt="Check and Stub" title="" />
<span class="caption">Check and Stub</span>
</div>

<p>Of course, before you could write a check for one hundred
dollars, you must have deposited at least one hundred dollars
in the bank on which the check is drawn. The bank supplies
you with a check book, consisting of blank checks, each
attached to a stub. When you write a check, you put the
same information on the stub to be kept for reference. Then
you tear off the check through the perforated line, using
it to pay for whatever you may have purchased.</p>

<p><i>Certified Check.</i>&mdash;Suppose, however, that you are writing
this check to pay a debt to a stranger who lives in another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
city. He may hesitate to accept it as money. That he may
have no cause to doubt your ability to pay the check, you
take it to your bank to have the cashier investigate your
account. If he finds that you have sufficient funds, he
writes or stamps <i>Accepted</i> or <i>Certified</i> on the check and signs
his name. At the same time the amount of the check is
deducted from your account. Such a check is accepted
without question when the holder is properly identified.</p>

<p><i>Endorsement.</i>&mdash;If A gives you his check for twenty-five
dollars, you could not receive the money until you had endorsed
the check; that is, put your name on the back,
which is, in effect, giving a receipt for the money. You
may do this in various ways. You may endorse:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. In blank; that is, merely write your name across the back.</p>

<p>2. In full, by saying, "Pay to the order of &mdash;&mdash;" and signing
your name.</p>

<p>3. By restricting the payment to a particular person; as,
"Pay to &mdash;&mdash;" This check cannot now be cashed by anyone
except the one named in the endorsement.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/gs346.png" width="600" height="282" alt="Express Money Order" title="" />
<span class="caption">Express Money Order</span>
</div>

<p><i>Express Money Order.</i>&mdash;An express money order is much
like a check, except that it is drawn on an express company
instead of on a bank and reads, for example: Continental
Express Company agrees to transmit and pay to the order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
of &mdash;&mdash; (the one to whom you are sending the money) &mdash;&mdash; (the
amount). The order is signed by the treasurer of the company
and countersigned by the agent who sells it. You can
buy such an order at any express office. It may be endorsed
like a check.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/gs347.png" width="600" height="214" alt="Postal Money Order" title="" />
<span class="caption">Postal Money Order</span>
</div>

<p><i>Postal Money Order.</i>&mdash;The other form of money order,
the postal, is an agreement signed by the postmaster of one
city that the postmaster of another city will pay the amount
of money named in the order to the person named in the
order.</p>

<p><i>Bank Draft.</i>&mdash;A bank draft is very much like a check,
except that instead of two individuals dealing with each
other two banks conduct the transaction, their places of business
being in different cities or villages. A bank draft is
sometimes called a bank check, because in the case of both
a draft and a check one party draws upon another with whom
the first has funds deposited. As a general rule, banks and
business houses require that remittances be sent to them
by drafts drawn on New York or Chicago banks, as there is
a charge called <i>exchange</i> made in the collection of checks
drawn on local banks.</p>

<p>In the draft that follows, the State Bank of Utah, of which
Henry T. McEwan is Assistant Cashier, makes out the
draft. The bank which is ordered to pay the money is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
National Park Bank of New York. The money is to be paid
to Henry L. Fowler. The State Bank of Utah is called the
drawer; the National Park Bank of New York, on whom the
draft is drawn, is the drawee; Henry L. Fowler is the payee.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/gs348a.png" width="600" height="288" alt="Bank Draft" title="" />
<span class="caption">Bank Draft</span>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><span class="caption">Endorsement</span>
<img src="images/gs348b.png" width="400" height="234" alt="Endorsement" title="" />

</div>

<p>The payment indicated above
was probably made without actually
sending the money from
Salt Lake City to New York.
It was done in this way:</p>

<p>Henry L. Fowler of Salt
Lake City owes one hundred
dollars to a man living in
an Eastern city, let us say Charles Emery of Rochester,
N. Y. Mr. Fowler goes to the State Bank of Utah in
Salt Lake City and "buys a draft on New York,"
made payable to himself. The bank makes out the above,
charging Mr. Fowler one hundred dollars plus a fraction
of one per cent for its trouble. Mr. Fowler endorses it
in full to Mr. Emery of Rochester and sends the draft to the
latter. He has the draft made payable to himself so that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
endorsement will constitute a full record of the transaction.
Mr. Emery takes the draft to his own bank in Rochester,
endorses it in blank, and receives the one hundred dollars.
Thus Mr. Fowler has paid out the money and Mr. Emery
has received it.</p>

<p>The way the banks conduct the transaction is as follows:
There are certain big money centers in the country; e.g.,
New York, Chicago, St. Louis, San Francisco. Important
banks in other places have money on deposit in at least one
bank in each of these centers. The banks which thus deal
with one another are called <i>correspondents</i>. The National
Park Bank is the correspondent of the State Bank of Utah.
When Mr. Emery cashes the draft at his Rochester bank, the
latter sends it to its New York correspondent, and at the
same time charges the correspondent one hundred dollars.
The correspondent presents the draft to the National Park
Bank, which pays the money and charges the same amount
to the State Bank of Utah. Explain how this settles the
transaction.</p>

<p><i>Time Draft.</i>&mdash;A time draft is much like a bank draft, in
that two banks conduct the principal part of the transaction
for two individuals, but no money is actually paid at
the time the draft is drawn. The details of a transaction of
this kind are explained on the following page.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/gs349.png" width="600" height="223" alt="Time Draft" title="" />
<span class="caption">Time Draft</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>Horace Prang of 1008 Elm Street, Columbus, Ohio, owes
Loetzer &amp; Co. five hundred dollars, due August 27, 1915.
Loetzer &amp; Co. make out the draft above and deposit it in
the Bank of Buffalo. The latter sends the draft to its correspondent
in Columbus, which presents the draft to Horace
Prang. If he is willing to pay the note when it falls due, he
writes across the face of it, "<i>Accepted</i>" adds the date, and
signs his name. It is now returned to the Bank of Buffalo.
The Bank of Buffalo will then discount the draft for Loetzer
&amp; Co.</p>

<p><i>Sight Draft.</i>&mdash;A sight draft is much like a time draft,
except that the amount is paid by the person on whom it is
drawn as soon as it is presented, instead of after a stipulated
length of time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/gs350.png" width="600" height="236" alt="Sight Draft" title="" />
<span class="caption">Sight Draft</span>
</div>

<p>Suppose the Empire Elevator Co. of Buffalo has sold $420
worth of grain to the Smith Milling Co. of Springfield, Mass.
When the grain is loaded on the cars, the railroad company
gives the Empire Elevator Co. a bill of lading. Now, the
Smith Milling Co. must possess this bill of lading before it
can take the grain from the cars at Springfield. The Empire
Elevator Co. deposits the bill of lading with the above draft
in the Marine National Bank of Buffalo. This bank sends
both to its correspondent in Springfield. The Springfield bank
presents the draft to the Smith Milling Co., who may take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
the grain from the cars on payment of the draft. In case
of non-payment, both draft and bill of lading are returned
to the Marine National Bank of Buffalo, and the Empire
Elevator Co. must make arrangements for the return or the
disposal of the grain.</p>

asks the bank to collect it. The maker of the note is William T.
Adams of Seattle. The Cashier writes to the bank's correspondent
in Seattle, the Scandinavian American Bank, asking the
latter to collect. Write the letter. (See <a href="#Exercise_301">Exercise 301</a>, 7.)</p>

<p>7. The Scandinavian American bank writes to William T.
Adams, telling him that it holds a note signed by him, due &mdash;&mdash;,
and asking him to make prompt payment. Write the letter.</p>

<p>8. Mr. Adams pays the note. The Seattle Bank notifies the
Milwaukee Bank, enclosing a draft for the amount. Write the
letter.</p>

<p>9. See <a href="#Exercise_301">Exercise 301</a>, 10. As John Elsworth's banker send the
coupons for the American Telephone and Telegraph bonds to
your correspondent in New York, the National City Bank,
because the interest is payable in New York. Ask the bank to
make the collection. Write the letter.</p>

<p>10. The National City Bank makes the collection and informs
you by means of a printed form that it has credited you with the
amount, $112.50. The form is just like a letter except that it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
already printed with blanks left for the name and the address
and for itemizing the coupons collected. Write such a form.</p>

<p>11. One of your depositors has overdrawn his account. Notify
him of the fact. Do this courteously so that the depositor may
have no reason to withdraw his account.</p>

<p>12. In your city there is a real estate dealer who often has
large sums of money idle for a short time because, when he sells
one piece of property, he does not always have another immediately
in view. He is not a depositor in your bank. Write to
him, inducing him to take out a Certificate of Deposit at such
times and telling him that the advantages of such a certificate are
that he will get 3% interest on the money deposited and that he
may draw out the money at any time.</p>

<p>13. One of your depositors has written to you, asking for a
loan of $5,000 for nine months. Write to him, saying that it is
not your practice to make time loans for definite periods longer
than six months, as it is not a good plan thus to tie up your deposits.
Explain that as most of a bank's deposits are payable on demand,
you would suggest his taking out a demand loan for $5,000, payable
on the demand of the bank. Under ordinary business conditions
such a loan might easily run for nine months.</p>

<p>14. R. F. Marsden, President of the Truesdale Cotton Mill,
Birmingham, Ala., has written to you, asking whether he can
secure a loan next fall on the cotton in the mill as collateral.
Reply that you feel certain that satisfactory arrangements could
be made if the cotton were stored in an accredited warehouse, so
that you could accept the warehouse receipt as collateral.</p></div>

<p>Write the following from dictation:</p>

<div class='center'>1<br />

<span class="smcap">The Daily Routine of the Clearing House</span></div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Each bank sends two clerks to the Clearing House: a delivering
clerk and a settling clerk. There are three rows of seats running
through the clearing room lengthwise, one in the center and
one on each side parallel with it. The settling clerks occupy these
seats and each one has a sufficient amount of desk room in front
of him to do his work on, his space being separated from his neighbors'
by a wire screen. The delivery clerks, with their packages
of checks in separate envelopes, stand in the open space in front
of the settling clerks. At two minutes before 10 o'clock the manager,
whose station is an elevated open space at the extreme end
of the room, strikes a bell.</p>

<p>The movement has all the precision of a military drill. When
the second bell sounds, at exactly 10 o'clock, each delivery clerk
takes one step forward, hands the proper package to the settling
clerk of the bank next to him, drops the accompanying ticket
showing the amount into an aperture like a letter box, and places<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
before the settling clerk his schedule, on which the latter places
his initials. Thus the procession moves uninterruptedly until
each delivery clerk has presented to each settling clerk the proper
package and ticket. Usually this part of the operation is completed
in ten minutes. Meanwhile the proof clerk, who occupies
a desk near the manager, has entered the claims of each bank
under the head "Bank Cr." on a broad sheet of paper.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the amount of each bank's claim against the
Clearing House (entered under the head "Banks Cr.") is the sum
of all the tickets which its delivery clerk has pushed into the
letter boxes of the other banks, it follows that all the tickets of
all the banks should equal all the entries under that head. The
next step in the operation is for each settling clerk to arrange the
amounts of all the tickets in his letter box in a column, add it
up, and send the amount to the proof clerk, who transcribes and
arranges it according to the bank's number under the head
"Banks Dr.," so that the debit of Bank A shall be on the same
line with its credit.</p>

<p>Then the difference between the two will show how much the
bank owes the Clearing House or how much the Clearing House
owes the bank. The time occupied by the settling clerks in
arranging their tickets and adding up the columns is about half
an hour. As fast as these footings are completed, they are sent
to the proof clerk, who puts them in the debit column opposite
the credits of the banks, respectively. When all are completed,
if no error has been made, the footings of the credit and debit
columns must be exactly equal and the footings of the two other
columns, which show the differences, must be exactly equal.
Then these differences are read off slowly and in a distinct tone by
the manager, so that each settling clerk can write down the sum
that his bank has to pay or to receive. As time is money at the
Clearing House, a fine is exacted for every error and every delay
in making footings, for every disobedience of the orders of the
manager, or for every instance of disorderly conduct.&mdash;Horace
White: <i>Money and Banking</i>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Treasury, in connection with its money washing, has asked
national banks to exercise more care in sending in money for
redemption. Banks frequently put into the same bundle, good
notes, bad notes, and notes of different denominations. When
they are mixed in this way, it requires a good deal of work to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
separate the money. The Treasury thinks that the banks could
do this work, so that, when the money reaches Washington, it could
easily be separated by packages instead of each package having
to be separated first. The Assistant Secretary says he believes
that, when he gets the subject worked out in detail, new washed
money will be returned to the bank in any denomination desired
on the same day that it is received; that money unfit for laundering
will be destroyed and new money issued. This expeditious
handling of money sent in for redemption cannot, however, be
attained, he admits, without the co-operation of the banks. In
a short time, he believes, all banks will see that it is to their
benefit to do this.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CORPORATION</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> study that we have thus far made of the various
kinds of businesses would be incomplete did we not briefly
outline the different types of organization by which modern
business is conducted. This will <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'natually'">naturally</ins> lead us to a discussion
of stocks and bonds, which are of great importance
in every big business and of interest to individuals as means
of investment. However, as the subjects are probably outside
the experience of most students, we shall treat them
as simply as possible, letting the chapter stand rather for
the information it contains than for its application to the
study of English expression.</p>

<p>Business to-day is carried on in three different ways;
viz., by individuals, by partnerships, and by corporations.
The grocer, the butcher, the baker, or any one man who
carries on a business is an example of the first. If, however,
the grocer and the butcher, or the grocer and the baker,
combine their businesses for the good of both, they form
a partnership. When the amount of capital necessary for
carrying on the business becomes so large that the money
of many people is needed, a <i>corporation</i> is formed. The
amount of money which any one individual invests in the
company is represented by a certain number of shares of the
<i>capital stock</i> of the company, entitling him to his portion
of the dividends, or interest on the money he has invested.
These shares of the capital stock are transferable and can
be bought and sold like an automobile or a house. Since
there is no time limit as to how long a corporation may do
business, a change in the ownership of part of the stock, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
the death of a stockholder, is not accompanied by the same
result as in a partnership, where the death of one of the
partners sometimes breaks up the business. Furthermore, in
a partnership each one of the partners is personally liable for
any debts made by any of the partners in behalf of the business,
whereas the personal possessions of a stockholder in a
corporation cannot be held as security for any debts incurred
by the corporation. These are two of the more important
advantages of corporate organization over partnership.</p>


<div class='center'><b>The Finances of a Corporation</b></div>

<p>It has been estimated that if one were to count money,
dollar by dollar, one dollar every second for eight hours six
days a week, it would take him six weeks to count one million
dollars, and over one hundred years to count a billion
dollars. This may help us to appreciate the sums of money
spoken of in the following: In 1914 the market value of
the Commonwealth Edison Company of Chicago was over
$83,000,000. The valuation placed on the properties of the
Chicago Railways Company in 1914 exceeded $79,000,000.
The Union Pacific Railroad Company had invested in its
properties in 1914 approximately $500,000,000. The capital
obligations of the United States Steel Corporation in 1914
were over $1,500,000,000. There are hundreds of such organizations
in our country, the investments in which run to
and beyond $50,000,000 each. It must be plain that, except
in a very few cases, these vast amounts of money do not
represent the investment of one, or of a few, but of many
persons. In uniting their capital, these persons decrease the
cost of making or distributing the product and so increase
their profits.</p>


<div class='center'><b>Stocks</b></div>

<p>When a large company of this kind is organized, a certain
amount of money is agreed upon to be the capital of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
company, and it is divided into small portions, ordinarily
$100 each, called <i>shares</i>. The total of the shares is called
the <i>authorized capital stock</i>. These shares are sold, the purchasers
of the shares being called <i>shareholders</i>, or <i>stockholders,</i>
of the company. The number of shares a person holds determines
what part of the profits he is entitled to. For
example, if a company is organized for 1000 shares of $100
each, or a capital stock of $100,000, and you owned 100
shares, you would be entitled to one-tenth of the divided
profits of the company. Such profits of the company,
divided proportionately among the stockholders, constitute
the <i>dividends</i>.</p>

<p>Often the capital stock is of two kinds, <i>preferred</i> and
<i>common</i>, as in the case of the Union Pacific R. R., which has
$200,000,000 of authorized preferred stock and $296,178,700
of authorized common stock. As the names signify, preferred
stock is ordinarily better than common stock, the dividends
on preferred stock being paid before any dividends are paid on
common stock and usually at a stated rate of interest; as, 4,
5, or 6 per cent. In the case of the Union Pacific, this rate is
4 per cent. If the company earns only enough profits to pay
the dividends on the preferred stock, the common gets no
dividends. On the other hand, if the profits are enormous,
the common occasionally gets more than the preferred.</p>


<div class='center'><b>Par and Market Value</b></div>

<p>The <i>par value</i> of a stock is the face value of one share of
stock, indicated on the face of the certificate. This may be
$10 or $50 or $100, whatever the amount agreed upon for one
share when the company is organized. The amount most
commonly used as par is $100. The <i>market value</i> of the
stock, however, need not be this amount, but may be greater
or less, dependent on how successful the company is and
what rate of dividends it pays. If a company's standing
is very good and the dividends are high (over 6 per cent),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
the stock will probably sell on the market above par. If
the company's finances are in a doubtful condition and there
are evidences that the company will pay small dividends,
if any at all, the market price of the stock will fall below
par. For example, in January, 1914, Union Pacific R. R.
common stock sold for about $158 per share, because the
finances of the company were in good condition and the company
had paid 10 per cent dividends steadily each year since
July 1, 1907. If, however, any occasion should arise to make
the public doubt the payment of future dividends at the same
rate, the stock would probably decline. To go to the other
extreme, in the same month Wabash R. R. common stock
sold as low as $8&frac12; per share, although the par is $100. This
was because for some years the company had paid no dividends
and was then in the hands of receivers. To take a
middle case in the same month and year, Erie R. R. first
preferred stock sold at about $45 per share, notwithstanding
the fact that since 1907 no dividends had been paid. The
reason for this seemingly high price was that the company
had for some time been reconstructing its property, had
gradually increased its business, had earned a $9,000,000
surplus in 1913, and had a good outlook to a dividend in
the near future.</p>

<p>These are not the only influences that affect the price of
stocks. The old factor of supply and demand has a great
influence on price. If, for example, a financier decides to
buy a large "block" of some stock, the market will almost
immediately be affected, and that stock will go up. One
example will suffice. In 1901 E. H. Harriman set out to
buy $155,000,000 worth of Northern Pacific stock in the
open market to gain control of the Northern Pacific railroad.
Of course, the market felt the demand, and the price of
the stock rose from a little above par until it touched $1,000
a share before it started back to normal. When Mr. Harriman
unloaded that same stock in 1906, because he failed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
to gain control, the market went down so considerably that
he lost $10,000,000 and almost caused a panic.</p>

<p>Often the stocks of a company sell below par because
the stock is watered; that is, the company has issued more
stock than there is value invested in the property. Many
of our railroads, for example, were built on borrowed money&mdash;that
is, from the proceeds of the sale of bonds&mdash;and, to
make the bonds sell more readily, stocks were given away
with them. This, of course, increased the capitalization
greatly without increasing the value. The temptation
in forming new companies, especially in mining schemes
and wildcat ventures, is to water the stock heavily by voting
a large block of stock gratis to the organizers. Before one
invests in any of these companies, he should thoroughly
investigate them. Sometimes companies water their stocks
when their dividends have become very large and they wish
to bring the rate down to that commonly paid. The Wells
Fargo Express Company did this in 1910, presenting their
stockholders with $16,000,000 worth of new stock without
any new investment in the property.</p>


<div class='center'><b>Bonds</b></div>

<p>Suppose that A owns a house with a store in it, and in
the store he carries on a grocery business. Suppose that by
enlarging his store and putting in a bigger stock of goods he
can make more money. The improvements will cost $1,000,
but he hasn't the money. He goes to B to ask B to lend
him $1,000 for five years, offering B the house as security.
B gives A the $1,000 and in return gets a certain amount of
interest each year and A's mortgage note against the property.
This means that, if at the end of five years A cannot pay
the $1,000, B has the right to sell A's house and collect the
money due him.</p>

<p>When a corporation borrows money to extend its properties,
plants, or rights, the transaction is really the same,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
although the form is somewhat different. Just as all the
capital stock of a corporation is divided into shares owned
by a number of people, so, when the corporation borrows
money, the amount borrowed is divided into smaller parts of
$500 or $1,000 each, called <i>bonds</i>, which the corporation sells
through its bankers to people who have idle money to invest.
Twice each year, as stated in the bond, the corporation
pays interest on the borrowed money at the rate, probably,
of 4, 4&frac12;, 5, or 6 per cent. After a definite number of years,
as stated in the bond, the corporation is obliged to pay back
the amount of money that it borrowed. This is called <i>redeeming</i>
the bonds. To show that it intends to pay back
the amount borrowed at the end of the time stated, or redeem
the bonds when they become due, the corporation
puts a mortgage on its real estate, buildings, machinery, and
equipment. When the bonds become due&mdash;or <i>mature</i>, as it
is called&mdash;if the corporation does not pay back the amount
borrowed, the holders of the bonds may take possession of
the company's real estate, buildings, machinery, and equipment
on which the company has placed the mortgage and
may sell them to recover the money they have loaned.
Thus, while the stockholders of a corporation have no assurance
that they will ever get their money back or will ever
get any interest on it, the holders of carefully selected bonds
are reasonably sure of getting a certain amount of interest
each year and of getting their money back when the bonds
mature. Shares of stock represent the investment made by
the stockholders who own the company, whereas bonds represent
the investment of those who loan money to the company.
We can readily see, then, that the stockholders take
the greater risk. For this reason it is expected that stocks
should yield a higher profit than bonds, and this is usually
the case.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the bonds that are issued by corporations
run for long periods&mdash;twenty, forty, fifty, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
even one hundred years. At times when money rates are
high, corporations that need funds are reluctant to pay a
high rate for so many years, and so they issue <i>short time
bonds</i> to run from two to five years, in the hope that at
the end of the time money rates will be lower and more
favorable to their issuing long time bonds. Many companies,
especially industrial corporations and railroads, have
issued obligations to pay, <i>notes</i> running from six months to
five years. They are not usually secured by a mortgage
on the property but are merely the company's promise to
pay, the interest and the principal taking precedence over
the dividends on the preferred and the common stocks.</p>


<div class='center'><b>Corporate Organization</b></div>

<p>Before a corporation can carry on its business, it must
obtain a charter from one of the states of the United States,
whose laws it must obey. The laws of some states are more
lenient than those of others, allowing the corporations more
privileges. New Jersey is thus lenient; consequently we find
many large corporations&mdash;such as the United States Steel
Corporation, the American Sugar Refining Company, and
others&mdash;organized under the laws of New Jersey. After the
charter is granted and the stock bought by the stockholders,
the latter have a meeting, at which they elect a small number
of men to be <i>directors</i>, who, as the name signifies, conduct
the business of the company for the stockholders. They
choose a president, one or more vice-presidents, a treasurer,
a secretary, and any other officers necessary to carry on the
business under the control of the directors. The term of
office of the directors is usually so fixed that the term of a
part of them expires each year, so that each year the
stockholders have an annual meeting at which they elect
new directors or re-elect the old ones whose term has
expired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><b>The Railroad</b></div>

<p>Corporations divide themselves into three large groups;
viz., railroad companies, public utility corporations, and
industrial corporations. Of these, the group composed of
the largest and most powerful corporations is the railroad
group.</p>

<p>Railroads have two general sources of income, the larger
being the revenue received from operating trains, both
freight and passenger; and the smaller being the return
from investments in other companies, from real estate, and
from the rental of lines, terminals, stations, and cars to other
railroads. To carry on the second or smaller part of its
business, the company needs an organization much like any
other business, but to conduct the first part it requires a
special organization. This divides itself into four departments,
usually with a vice-president at the head of each:
(1) the traffic department, (2) the operating department,
(3) the finance and accounting department, and (4) the
legal department.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the traffic department to get the business
for the company and adjust all traffic claims. In
short, it does everything to increase the business and the
earnings. This department naturally divides into the
freight traffic and passenger traffic departments, with a
superintendent or manager at the head of each.</p>

<p>After the traffic department has solicited the business for
the company, it is the duty of the operating department to
render the services required by the traffic department. The
work is done by four large divisions: (1) the engineering
or construction department, whose duty it is to build the
roads over which the company may operate; (2) the maintenance-of-way
department, whose duty it is to see that the
roadbed and rails are kept in good order and repair; (3)
the equipment department, whose duty it is to see that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
company is supplied with proper locomotives and cars and
to see that such equipment is kept in repair; and (4) the
transportation department, which has to do with the
operating of the trains.</p>

<p>The financial policy of a railroad is usually in charge of
one of the vice-presidents, who must be a man of experience
in financial matters and who acts with the approval
of the directors. The accounting department is more important
than may appear at first sight. Railroads are
now under the supervision and regulation of the government,
and one of the rights that the government has is
to examine the books of the company at any time and to
require all companies to submit a monthly report to the
government.</p>

<p>The legal department of a railroad is especially important
for two reasons: (1) In performing its services, the company
has business dealings with a large number of persons, and
in the adjustment of claims against the railroad, expert
legal advice is constantly necessary. (2) The railroad, as
stated above, is under the regulation and control of the
state and the national governments, and the enforcement
of this regulation makes the railroad a party to numerous
proceedings in the courts and before the Interstate Commerce
Commission. The large railroads operate in from ten
to twenty states. It can thus easily be seen that the legal
department has a great deal more to do than if the railroad
operated under but one political power.</p>


<div class='center'><b>Public Utility Corporations</b></div>

<p>Public utility corporations supply services without which
the people of to-day could not very well live. They are
those supplying water, light, heat, power, telephones, local
transportation, gas, etc. They may properly be called public
necessity corporations. The nature of these businesses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
practically gives them a monopoly in their locality; this is
the reason that they have grown so enormously during the
last thirty years. The Commonwealth Edison Company,
which supplies a large part of Chicago with light and
power, began in 1887 with a capital of $500,000 and in
1914 its capital obligations had a market value of over
$83,000,000. The American Telephone and Telegraph
Company began in 1885 with $12,000,000 of capital stock
and in 1914 had practically $340,000,000. The other public
service corporations have kept pace, according to the growth
of the locality they serve. In the depression of 1907 this
class of corporation kept steadily increasing the volume of
its business when all others went back a step. Since these
corporations are dependent on the local community for
their business, if the community grows the company must
grow, and usually faster than the community. For this
reason the stocks and bonds of these companies are usually
a good investment.</p>

<p>It is a common practice for municipalities to demand a
share of the profits of the company, by way of a fixed
sum, a certain percentage of the gross profits, or a share
of the net profits. For example the city of Chicago receives,
from the Commonwealth Edison Company each year 3 per
cent of its gross receipts from the sale of current and 10
per cent of its gross receipts from the rental of conduit space,
amounting in 1913 to more than $300,000, quite a considerable
sum. The Chicago Railways Company and the
Chicago City Railway Company, the two large street car
companies of Chicago, after deductions for expenses and
charges and 5 per cent on the amount invested are made
from the gross income, pay to the city 55 per cent of the
surplus earnings, keeping for themselves 45 per cent.
Whenever these companies pay part of their earnings to
the municipality, they are really under municipal supervision,
and their books and accounts are open to examination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
by the city at any time. These companies are called
quasi-municipal corporations.</p>


<div class='center'><b>Industrial Corporations</b></div>

<p>As the name indicates, industrial corporations are those
that carry on our industries. They are by far the largest
class of corporations and have among their number some
very powerful companies, whose assets run up toward the
billions. This class of corporations has not had the gradual,
steady growth of the public utility corporations, but in the
case of the most successful, the growth has been amazing.
The Standard Oil Company for many years prior to its dissolution
had paid dividends on its capital stock of about
$100,000,000 at the rate of 40 per cent a year. The Steel
Corporation is said to have produced a thousand millionaires
and is still producing them. This class of corporations has
not been so closely under the supervision of the federal and
municipal authorities as the railroads and public utility corporations,
and their financing has been carried on in a looser
fashion than that of the other two classes. For this reason
the securities of these corporations are not generally regarded
as highly as those of the other two. However, the federal
government has taken and is taking steps to regulate these
corporations, and this will tend to bring them eventually to
the standards of the railroad and public utility corporations.</p>

<p>Write the following from dictation:</p>

<div class='center'>1</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In New London, Connecticut, stands the oldest grist mill in the
country. It is a picturesque building, having a water wheel like
the one that it originally used when New London was first settled.
The town was in the center of an agricultural community,
and a mill to grind corn was a need that soon manifested itself
to the settlers. Accordingly, in 1650 at a town meeting, six
men were chosen to build a mill. John Winthrop and his heirs
were granted the right to carry on the grist mill as long as they
maintained the building placed in their charge. This is one of
the first monopolies recorded in New England history.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />2</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The same standards by which a farming or a manufacturing
investment may be judged are not applicable to a mining investment.
A farmer may earn eight per cent on his capital, and with
care his investment may increase in value. A manufacturer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
may earn eight per cent on his investment, and, if he keeps up his
machinery, his business may be as valuable ten years, or even
twenty years, hence; but a mine, after each dividend is paid, is
that much nearer its end. Now, it is well known among mining
men that the average life of a gold or silver mine is under, rather
than over, ten years. There are exceptions to this rule, of course,
but, granting that the life of a certain gold or silver mine is to be
ten years, then, in order to pay back both principal and interest,
dividends of at least sixteen per cent should be distributed. Copper
mining, of which the statistics have been most accurately
kept in New York and Boston, offers many inducements to the
investor; but too much care cannot be taken in the matter of
selection, for copper stocks, in not a few instances, have been
boosted out of all reason. As with gold and silver mines, so it
is with copper mines. They have so much ore to begin with, and
after each dividend are that much nearer to the day when they
will close down. For such mines, provided they have a good
lease of life, eight per cent or even ten per cent may be regarded
as only moderate returns. These are merely samples of some
general principles to be followed.&mdash;<i>Roger W. Babson.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot">Dear Sir:

<p>At the close of a year which has presented many perplexing
problems, not only to investors and dealers in bonds, but also to
borrowing municipalities and corporations, there are several
factors in the situation which in our opinion offer strong encouragement
to every one in any way interested in bond investments.</p>

<p>Of special significance is the marked change in sentiment which
has recently taken place. There is every indication that this
country enters the new year with an unusually substantial feeling
of confidence. While a notable increase in the demand
for bonds would undoubtedly bring out a large amount of new
financing, on the other hand, there has been an accumulation
of funds during the period of depressed markets, and it is generally
understood that investment dealers are carrying comparatively
small amounts of bonds.</p>

<p>January has an almost unbroken record of higher average bond
prices than the average prices in December. It is not our intention
to predict an advance this January, although there are unquestionably
many reasons for anticipating at least a moderate
improvement; but, viewing the question in its broader aspects,
we find many convincing arguments in favor of the purchase of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
bonds at this time. It is recognized that the decline in prices
has been due to a variety of causes, which, except in a few individual
cases, are not the result of any depreciation in real values.
Basic conditions are admittedly sound. We, accordingly, not
only recommend the judicious purchase of bonds for the investment
of surplus funds, but also suggest consideration of the advisability
in some cases of converting short time securities into
long time bonds.</p>

<p>What conditions could be more favorable from the standpoint
of the purchaser of bonds than an extremely low level of prices;
a wide-spread belief that fundamental conditions are sound; a
general feeling of confidence that the problems which have tended
to disturb business during the past year have been, or are being,
solved; and a conviction that we are entering upon a period of
probable ease in money rates?</p>

Very truly yours,<br />

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
